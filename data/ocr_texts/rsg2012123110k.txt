time of the employment termination the Employee is a "specified employee" as defined in Section

of such employment termination is necessary to avoid the additional tax under Section 409A, the

with respect to any business-related matters or any actual or threatened legal action (including testifying
in depositions, hearings, and/or trials). In addition, Employee agrees to promptly inform the Company
(by telephonic or written communication to Republic Services, Inc., Legal Department, 18500 North
Allied Way, Phoenix, AZ 85054, phone number 480-627-2714) if any person or business contacts
Employee in an effort to obtain information about the Company.

Phoenix, Arizona 85054
ATTN: General Counsel

If to the Employee: — 25903 Edinborough Circle

of the Company.

9.4 Entire Agreement, No Oral Amendments. This Agreement replaces all previous
agreements and discussions relating to any employment relationship between Employee and the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliated entities and constitutes the entire agreement between
Employee and the Company with respect to the matters addressed in this Agreement. This Agreement
may not be modified in any respect except by a written agreement signed by an executive officer of the
Company. Employee acknowledges that upon the Effective Date of this Agreement it replaces
Employee's prior agreement with Allied Waste or the Company or any of its subsidiaries and that

venue will be proper only in a court or arbitral forum in Maricopa County, Arizona.

9.7 Arbitration. With the sole exception of any breach by Employee of the obligations
Employee assumed under a non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality

agreement (the breach of which permits the Company to obtain judicial relief due to the exigent
circumstances presented by such a breach), all other alleged breaches of this Agreement, or any other
dispute between the Parties arising out of or in connection with Employee's employment with the
Company will be settled by binding arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law. This Agreement
to arbitrate applies to any claim for relief of any nature, including but not limited to claims of
wrongful discharge under statutory law and common law; employment discrimination based on
federal, state or local statute, ordinance, or governmental regulations, including discrimination
prohibited by: (a) Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended,

(b) the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, (c) the Americans with Disabilities Act, (d) the

Fair Labor Standards Act; claims of retaliatory discharge or other acts of retaliation;
compensation disputes; tortious conduct; allegedly contractual violations; ERISA violations; and other
statutory and common law claims and disputes, regardless of whether the statute was enacted or
whether the common law doctrine was recognized at the time this Agreement was signed.

The Parties understand that they are agreeing to substitute one legitimate dispute
resolution forum (arbitration) for another (litigation) because of the mutual advantages this forum
offers, and are waiving their right to have their disputes resolved in court except for breaches by the
Employee of Employee's non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality obligations.

The arbitration proceeding will be conducted in Maricopa County, Arizona in accordance with
the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes (National Rules) of the American
Arbitration Association (AAA) in effect at the time a demand for arbitration is made. The Company
will pay all costs and expenses of the arbitration, except for the filing fees and costs that would have
been required had the proceeding been initiated and maintained in the Maricopa County Superior
Court, which fees and costs Employee will pay. Each Party will pay their own attorneys' fees and
expenses throughout the arbitration proceeding. However, the arbitrator may award the successful
Party its attorneys' fees and expenses at the conclusion of the arbitration and any other relief provided
by law.
