Supplier shall not make any changes to the manufacturing processes without Maxim’s prior written approval.

The Parties may agree to implement an improvement in the Plant for general quality and efficiency purposes.
In such case, the Parties will share the reasonable costs of implementing such improvement.

4 FORECASTS; PURCHASE ORDERS.

4.1

Forecasts; Minimum Order and Supply Commitments. Once a month during the Term, Maxim will provide
Supplier with a non-binding rolling [***] forecast of Maxim’s then-current good faith estimate of its Purchase
Orders for Wafers for such [***] period, which shall be for informational purposes only and not be legally
binding on Maxim. Starting on January 1, 2016, MIPI agrees to place Purchase Orders in line with the Lead
Time for, and purchase, and Supplier shall Manufacture and deliver upon such Purchase Orders in accordance
with this Agreement, including, without limitation, the Manufacturing Requirements, at least the minimum
quantities of Wafers based on the applicable Moves [***] (the “Minimum Quantities”). Any non-shipment of
any Wafers of not more than [***] (if less Wafers are shipped than ordered or if the delivery date is delayed)
shall not be a breach of this Agreement nor of Supplier’s minimum supply commitment under this Agreement
if caused during the ordinary course of business, including line yield loss and Plant excursions. Supplier, at its
sole discretion, will provide Maxim with the additional required Wafers within a reasonable time and invoice
Maxim only for the Wafers actually shipped. MIPI shall not be obligated to place any Purchase Orders, and
Maxim shall not be obligated to purchase any Wafers, above the Minimum Quantities. Supplier shall not be
obligated to supply Wafers in excess of the Minimum Quantities, provided that if: (i) MIPI places Purchase
Orders during any calendar quarter of a calendar year [***] in excess of the quarterly Minimum Quantities for
such calendar year to be consistent with the Minimum Quantities for such calendar year, Supplier shall supply
such excess quantity of Wafers on such Purchase Order, and (ii) MIPI otherwise places a Purchase Order for

5

42

43

44

4.5

4.6

47

48

more than the Minimum Quantities, Supplier shall make reasonable efforts to Manufacture and supply MIPI
with such excess quantity. Either Party may request a change to such minimum commitments during any given
year, which shall be effected by mutual written agreement of the Parties. Any reduction in Supplier’s minimum
supply commitment as agreed to by the Parties will also automatically, without need for any notice or additional
agreement, result in a corresponding reduction in Maxim’s minimum order commitment for the time during
which such reduction is in place.

Purchase Orders. MIPI will use reasonable efforts to provide Supplier with each Purchase Order in accordance
with the Lead Time. A Purchase Order sent to Supplier by email, facsimile transmission or other electronic
means shall constitute a writing for all legal purposes and, once accepted by Supplier, will be a binding
commitment of Maxim to purchase, and Supplier to sell and supply, the Wafers ordered in such Purchase Order.

Acknowledgment. Within [***] of Supplier’s receipt of each Purchase Order, Supplier shall accept or reject
the Purchase Order by signing and returning it to Maxim via return mail, email, confirmed facsimile, or other
electronic means. [***] Supplier will provide FCD for each Deliverable specified in the Purchase Order.

During the transition period post-Closing, the current methodology implemented at the Plant on the date hereof
will be maintained including planning, wafer starts plan and delivery. Maxim will provide a blanket PO that
will reflect the wafers start plan and the Supplier will issue invoices for aggregated wafers once a week. This
will not change Maxim’s minimum purchase commitment and the supplier commitment to delivery as set forth
in Sections 4.1 and 8.3. The Parties will make their best efforts to implement a commercial system that will
enable the procedure defined in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 above.

Before the [***] of the Closing Date, the Parties will review their procedures with respect to forecasts, issuance
of Purchase Orders, acknowledgement and general course of business. The Parties may mutually revise the

procedures set forth herein in order to allow the Plant to ramp products of other customers.

Disruption of Production. For the quantity of Wafers consistent with the Minimum Quantities:

(i) [***] Maxim’s Purchase Orders shall be fulfilled in accordance with the Manufacturing Cycle Time
requirements, and

(ii) Supplier shall [***] allow [***] production or delivery of Deliverables for Maxim in accordance with
the relevant Manufacturing Requirements.

Request for Production Holds. So long as Maxim continues to fulfill its take or pay obligations per Section
8.3 (unless Supplier breaches its minimum supply obligation hereunder), and without derogating from such take
or pay and such minimum supply obligations:

4.7.1 Supplier agrees to hold production of Deliverables in process for a maximum period of [***] at Maxim’s
request for Deliverables that have not been fully verified. Supplier agrees to hold lots for engineering
reasons for a period of [***] free of charge.

4.7.2 Requests to hold lots for engineering reasons for a period of more than [***] will be handled pursuant
to the Purchase Order cancellation provisions set forth in Section 4.7.1.

Purchase Order Changes. So long as Maxim continues to fulfill its take or pay obligations per Section 8.3
(unless Supplier breaches its minimum supply obligation hereunder), and without derogating from such take or
pay and such minimum supply obligations:

4.8.1 Early Cancellation. Maxim may cancel any Purchase Order at any time prior to Wafer lot start date,
and shall reimburse Supplier for the actual price paid by Supplier for any unique materials that Supplier
shows through written documentation to have procured especially and only for Maxim and to not be
reasonably usable by Supplier otherwise, including, without limitation, for Manufacturing Wafers for
Maxim under other Purchase Orders. If Maxim cancels after the Wafer lot start date, Maxim shall pay
Supplier a cancellation charge based upon mask layers completed at the time of receipt of the
cancellation notice plus the substrate cost actually incurred by Supplier therefor.

4.9

4.8.2 Reschedule Purchase Order. Maxim shall have the right to reschedule any Purchase Order by up to
[***] from the FCD (in case of metal mask revision, it could be up to [***] if such rescheduling request
is provided to Supplier in writing more than [***] prior to the Delivery Date for any such Purchase
Order.

Electronic Communication. Supplier agrees that the Parties will use electronic means to provide and receive
communications relating to this Agreement, including without limitation, purchase orders, invoices, and inventory
reporting. Supplier agrees that it will complete Maxim’s EDI Trading Partner Agreement and other documents as
reasonably requested by Maxim to enable electronic data exchanges between the Parties. The Parties shall be
responsible for their own costs relating to setting up and maintaining such electronic data exchanges.

Take-or-Pay Agreement.

8.3.1

8.3.2

8.3.3

8.3.4

Starting on the later of (i) January 1, 2016 or (ii) Closing Date, as long as Supplier materially meets
its obligations to deliver Wafers (with “materially” meaning that, during a calendar quarter, Supplier
would not materially meet its obligations if [***] to be delivered by Supplier to Maxim under this
Agreement during such calendar quarter is not delivered) (so long as such non-delivery is not due to
Maxim’s fault)) in the amount purchased by MIPI in accordance with Parties’ obligations under Section
4.1, Maxim shall purchase from Supplier quantities of Wafers based on the quantity of Moves in
accordance with the minimum order obligation under Section 4.1 and pay to Supplier, during a given
calendar year, [***].

In the event that the Closing Date will be after January 1, 2016, the Quarterly Minimum Payments, and
Maxim’s take or pay obligation under this Section 8.3, will be prorated for the time between January
1, 2016 and the Closing Date. In the event Supplier manufactures Moves within [***] its minimum
supply obligation under Section 4.1 during a calendar quarter, Maxim’s take or pay obligations on an
annual basis as set forth in Section 8.3 below shall remain unchanged and stay in effect, [***].

The minimum quantities of Wafers to be purchased by MIPI during each calendar quarter of a given
year shall be that quantity corresponding to [***] (the “Quarterly Minimum Quantity”), except that,
if Maxim actually purchases during any calendar quarter ofa given year [***], the Quarterly Minimum
Quantity, Maxim shall pay the full Quarterly Minimum Payment, provided that, [***], subject to Maxim
complying with its annual obligations under the take or pay agreement in this Agreement to order
Wafers corresponding to the aggregate quantity of Moves for such calendar year [***]. For clarification,
in case there is a quarter which is [***], however, during said calendar year, no additional quarter will
be [***].

If Maxim purchases and is supplied Wafers during any calendar quarter in a given year in such quantity
corresponding to Moves that exceed the Quarterly Minimum Quantity for such calendar quarter (the
difference between the quantity of such Moves and the Quarterly Minimum Quantity for such calendar
quarter being referred to herein as “Excess Overload Quantity”, and Excess Overload Quantity

8

8.4

8.5

8.6

multiplied by the Price-per-Move applicable to such calendar quarter being referred to herein as “Excess
Overload Payment”), Maxim shall pay for the Price for the supplied Wafers [***].

8.3.5 If Maxim purchases and is supplied Wafers during any calendar quarter in a given year in such quantity
corresponding to Moves that is less than the Quarterly Minimum Quantity for such calendar quarter
(the difference between the quantity of such Moves and the Quarterly Minimum Quantity for such
calendar quarter being referred to herein as “Excess Underload Quantity”, and Excess Underload
Quantity multiplied by the Price-per-Move applicable to such calendar quarter being referred to herein
as “Excess Underload Payment”), Maxim shall pay the Quarterly Minimum Payment owed under
this Agreement for such calendar quarter [***].

8.3.6 Notwithstanding the foregoing, as long as Supplier materially meets its obligation to deliver purchased
Wafers in no less than quantities ordered by MIPI from Supplier in accordance with the minimum
supply obligation under Section 4.1 and the Manufacturing Requirements, Maxim must comply with
the payment obligation under the terms of the take or pay agreement herein during each year equal to
the applicable Quarterly Minimum Payment multiplied by four (4), and in the event that any amount
of such payment owed is not satisfied, Maxim shall pay the deficit amount to Supplier within thirty
(30) days of issuance of the relevant invoice therefor.

83.7 [**],

8.3.8 Notwithstanding the foregoing of this Section 8.3 and Section 3.4, if the average cycle time (over a
calendar quarter) in the Term exceeds the average cycle time at the Plant before the Closing Date [***],
the Quarterly Minimum Payments, and the take or pay obligation, of Maxim for each such calendar
quarter will be [***] that is [***], without prejudice to other rights and remedies. [***].

8.3.9 Nothing in this Section 8.3 or in Section 4.1 shall affect any right or remedy of Maxim in the event of
Supplier’s failure to deliver any ordered Wafers or Supplier’s delivery of any defective Wafers or any
other breach of this Agreement by Supplier.

Technology Improvements and Operational Licensed Technology for which Maxim is liable for indemnity to
Supplier under Section 18.2), all as specified in Section 11.3. Supplier will have full control over, and Maxim
will cooperate with and provide all reasonable assistance (at Maxim’s expense) to support Supplier in the defense
and settlement of the Claim. Maxim will notify Supplier of the Claim within three (3) business days of Maxim’s
receipt of the Claim. Supplier will have no liability or obligation under this Section 18.1 with respect to any
Claim to the extent it is (a) based upon the combination of Supplier or Maxim Technology with any parts,
materials, components, products, processes, devices, hardware, or software provided by Maxim; (c) based upon
any modification to or derivatives of the Supplier or Maxim Technology made by Maxim; (d) based upon third
party parts, materials, components, products, processes, devices, hardware, or software; (e) based upon adherence
or compliance by Supplier with specifications or instructions from Maxim; (f) based upon continuing
infringement by Maxim after Supplier has provided Maxim with a non-infringing substitute for the accused
Supplier or Maxim Technology, or (g) made in response to a claim, action, or threatened action by Maxim or
on behalf of Maxim.

Indemnification by Maxim. Without limiting any of Maxim’s indemnification obligations under the Asset
Purchase Agreement, Maxim agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Supplier harmless from and against, any and
all settlement amounts, damages, costs, and other expenses finally awarded in a non-appealable judgment
rendered by a court or administrative body, or agreed to in a written settlement signed by Maxim, solely arising
out of or resulting from: (i) any claim of direct infringement of any third party’s IP Right(s) by any use of any
(aa) Maxim-Designated Technology, and any Maxim Technology Improvements or (bb) any Operational
Licensed Technology as provided by Maxim to Supplier if and to the extent, but only if and to the extent, such
claim of infringement arises from any Wafer that Supplier made for and delivered to Maxim and not from any
Wafer that Supplier made for itself or any of its Affiliates or made for or delivered to any third party, under this
Agreement, or (ii) Maxim’s material breach of any ofits obligations under this Agreement as specified in Section
11.4 (“Claim”). Maxim will have full control over, and Supplier will cooperate with and provide all reasonable
assistance (at Supplier’s expense) to support Maxim in the defense and settlement of the Claim. Supplier will
notify Maxim of the Claim within three (3) business days of Supplier’s receipt of the Claim. Maxim will have
no liability or obligation under this Section 18.2 with respect to any Claim to the extent it is (a) based upon use
of Maxim Technology or Maxim Technology Improvements (“Maxim Indemnified Technology”) outside the
license thereto under Section 15.2 or the Purpose or in violation of this Agreement; (b) based upon the combination
of Maxim Indemnified Technology with any parts, materials, components, products, processes, devices,
hardware, or software not provided by Maxim; (c) based upon any modification to or derivatives of the Maxim
Indemnified Technology not made by Maxim; (d) based upon third party parts, materials, components, products,
processes, devices, hardware, or software; (e) based upon adherence or compliance by Maxim with specifications
or instructions from Supplier; (f) based upon continuing infringement by Supplier after Maxim has provided
Supplier with a non-infringing substitute for the accused Maxim Indemnified Technology, or (g) made in response
to a claim, action, or threatened action by Supplier or on behalf of Supplier.

rights or obligations under this Agreement to any third party without the other Party’s prior written consent.
Any such attempted assignment or delegation shall be null and void.

Non-Exclusivity. Nothing expressed or implied in this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict either Party’s

there is a dispute between the Parties, the Parties agree that they will first attempt to resolve the dispute through
one senior management member of each Party named as a representative of the Party to resolve the dispute. If
they are unable to do so within sixty (60) days after the complaining Party’s written notice to the other Party,

acts of God and acts of governmental authority or acts of war, power outages, power shortages, acts of terrorism,
or acts of a civil or military authority (“Force Majeure”). The Party claiming Force Majeure shall notify the
other Party, in writing, within [***] after the occurrence of the Force Majeure event specifying the nature and
anticipated duration of the delay. Supplier shall use reasonable efforts to avoid or minimize the effects of delay
or non-performance and the Schedule shall be amended to take into account the delay caused by the Force
Majeure event. During any Force Majeure event, Maxim’s obligations under Section 8.3 shall be suspended.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event any delay extends for a period of more than [***], or any agreed
upon extension, Maxim shall have the right to procure Wafers from another supplier in order to meet its Customer
