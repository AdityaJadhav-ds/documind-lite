means) the computer programs and user manuals (collectively, "Software"), now or later owned by
Software Owner.

Trademark License. Software Owner grants Publisher a nonexclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right
and license to use its trademarks, trade names, service marks, logos or other identifying or

Distribution. Publisher, at its sole discretion and at any time, may refuse to distribute any piece of
Software from Software Owner that it deems inappropriate. In addition, Publisher, at its sole
discretion and at any time, reserves the right to choose which Value Added Channel or Channels, as
described in Exhibit B ("Channels"), if any, to distribute the Software.

Demonstration License. Software Owner grants Publisher a royalty-free nonexclusive right and
license to use, publicly display, publicly perform, and duplicate the Software either directly by
Publisher's employees or through Publisher's Channel Partners solely for the purpose of marketing
or demonstrating the Software to prospective customers. Such marketing or demonstration efforts
may include demonstrating the Software online via an Internet accessible emulation device,
webcasting, or other means.

Suites. Publisher reserves the right to ask Software Owner to refrain from incorporating the word
"Suite" in the Software name. Upon receipt of this request in writing, Software Owner must make
any necessary changes to the Software within twenty-one (21) days.

Obligations of Software Owner. Software Owner will not forward the Customer Information it
receives from Publisher (as defined in Section 3(c)) to any third parties. Unless otherwise noted,
Software Owner will provide, at no charge, to Publisher or, where applicable, the customer, the
following:

volume pricing model for any Software, Publisher and Publisher's Channel Partners may use
Publisher's standard volume pricing model for sales of that Software in multiple quantities. The
volume pricing model used for sales of Software in multiple quantities will determine the suggested
retail price ("SRP") for the Software. Software Owner may view Publisher's standard volume
pricing model through Software Owner's online account with Publisher accessible via Publisher's
website, and Publisher may update Publisher's standard volume pricing model at its sole discretion
and at any time.

Obligations of Publisher.

resolving problems not primarily caused by the Software's malfunction.

Reports. Publisher will use reasonable efforts to provide Software Owner on a monthly basis an
Invoice Report that identifies the number of customers who purchased the Software and have
submitted payment to Publisher and the customer name and contact information (collectively,
"Customer Information"), provided Software Owner is not in breach of any of its obligations.

Returns. Returns from customers will be made in accordance with Publisher's Return Policy as
described on Publisher's website at www.handango.com, which Return Policy may be updated by
Publisher at its sole discretion and at any time.

Software or for any unpaid purchases. Returns from customers will be credited against sales of
Software. If Publisher fails to pay any amounts when due, Publisher shall pay Software Owner
interest on the unpaid amount at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum.

Verification. Software Owner may, once every twelve (12) months and at its sole expense, hire an
independent accountant to audit Publisher's financial records to the extent reasonably necessary to
verify Publisher's compliance with its payment obligations under this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any financial records not audited within a twelve (12) month period will be deemed
accurate and not subject to review. Should such audit discover a discrepancy of ten percent (10%)
or more in the Software Owner's favor, Software Owner shall be reimbursed for the costs of such
audit, in addition to receiving the adjusted payment.

Limitation of Liability. INNO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER

YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT THE INFORMATION PROVIDED BELOW IS

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOFTWARE OWNER AND HAVE THE POWER AND
AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO AND BIND SOFTWARE OWNER TO THIS AGREEMENT.
YOU AND THE SOFTWARE OWNER, ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS
AGREEMENT (WHICH INCLUDES ALL EXHIBITS), UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

Exhibit A
SOFTWARE PARTNER PROGRAM

All trial versions of the Software provided by Software Owner pursuant to this Agreement must
clearly direct the customer only to the Publisher to register and/or purchase the Software. The
reference to the Publisher within the trial version of the Software must include the main URL of
Publisher's website at www.handango.com or a specific web page accessible through
www.handango.com and must be displayed, at a minimum, in the registration screen(s). If any
Software does not contain a registration screen, then the reference and link to the Publisher and the
Publisher's website must be displayed in all comparable introductory or informational screens.
Consistent with the foregoing, Publisher grants to Software Owner a limited royalty-free
nonexclusive and non-transferable license to incorporate and display the Publisher's Marks in the
Software computer programs.

For any Software sold through Publisher's Basic or Value Added Channels (Basic and Value Added
Channels are listed in Exhibit B), Publisher will purchase the Software at a cost equal to a product
of the Software's SRP multiplied by the percentage of the Software's SRP owed to Software Owner
as a royalty. Software Owner will provide the SRP for all Software being distributed pursuant to
this Agreement. At no time shall the Software's SRP provided to Publisher be higher than the
Software's SRP provided to other distributors. The actual retail price of the Software to be
determined by Handango may differ from the SRP provided by Software Owner.

During the first year that any Software is sold through Publisher's Basic or Value Added Channels,
Publisher shall pay Software Owner a royalty for each sale equal to percentages of the Software's
SRP according to the following table:

Basic Channels:

70%

Value Added Channels:

70% for sales up to and including $10,000 per year

60% for sales over $10,000 up to and including $50,000 per year

50% for sales over $50,000 up to and including $100,000 per year; and
40% for sales over $100,000 per year.

In the first calendar year of this agreement, Software Owner's Royalty for Value Added Channel
sales will be adjusted according to the table set forth above based on the aggregate dollar sales
transacted through all of the Value Added Channels. In all subsequent years of this Agreement,
Software Owner's Royalty for Value Added Channel sales will be set at the royalty level achieved in
the prior calendar year (based on the prior year's volume sales) and will remain fixed at that royalty
level throughout that calendar year until Value Added Channel sales reach the next highest level in
the table above at which time the Software Owner's Royalty for Value Added Channel sales will be
adjusted. If aggregate dollar sales transacted through all of the Value Added Channels in any
calendar year is less than the amount in the prior calendar year, Software Owner's royalty will
increase according to the table set forth above and begin in the subsequent calendar year.

Thus, by way of example, if the aggregate sales volume of all Software through all Value Added
Channels is $40,000 in year one of this Agreement, then the Software Owner's Royalty for the
following year will be set initially at 60% for all sales through Value Added Channels. If the
aggregate sales volume of all Software through all Value Added Channels is $60,000 in year two,
then the Software Owner's Royalty will be set initially at 50% for all sales through Value Added
Channels in year three. If the aggregate sales volume of all Software through all Value Added
Channels is $40,000 in year three, then the Software Owner's Royalty will be set initially at 60% for
all sales through Value Added Channels in year four.

IT IS THE PARTIES' EXPRESS INTENT TO CONCLUDE AND BE BOUND BY THE TERMS
OF THIS AGREEMENT EVEN IF A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION FINDS THE
AGREEMENT DOES NOT FIX THE PRICE(S) FOR THE SOFTWARE TO BE DISTRIBUTED
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

Exhibit B

CHANNELS

Publisher's main website, www.handango.com, is a Basic Channel.

Publisher's Value Added Channels include, but are not limited to, the following:

reasonably designate. The list of channels set forth above is not exhaustive and Software Owner will
be notified by reasonable means, including the Publisher's electronic newsletters, when Publisher
establishes or opens new distribution channels or re-designates existing channels in Publisher's sole
and reasonable discretion (either from Basic to Value Added or vice versa). Publisher will not re-
designate a Basic Channel to a Value Added Channel without a change in the conditions in which
Software is distributed through that Basic Channel (such changes may include, but is not limited to,
an increase in distribution cost or other resources required to maintain that distribution channel).
Publisher reserves the right to establish new distribution channels with terms that differ from the
terms of the Basic and Value Added Channels set forth in Exhibit A. In accordance with Section 9c,
