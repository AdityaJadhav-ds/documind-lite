EXHIBIT 10(viii)(b)

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT, effective , is between THE CLOROX
COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and (the "Executive").
RECITAL

The Company and the Executive want to enter a written agreement concerning the
terms of the Executive's employment with the Company and the terms of the termination of that
employment.

TERMS OF AGREEMENT
1. Term of Employment.
(a) Basic Term. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the effective date of

this Agreement and end upon the earliest of (i) the second anniversary thereof (the "Term Date"),
as, and to the extent, extended under Section 1 (b), (ii) the date upon which the Executive's
employment is terminated in accordance with Section 4, and (iii) the first day of the month
following the Executive's 65th birthday.

(b) Extension of Term. Subject to Section 1(a)(iii) and to Section 4, the Term Date
will be automatically extended from the inception of this Agreement until the Company gives the
Executive written notice that automatic extension has ceased and that this Agreement is to be
terminated on the Term Date as extended to that point. The Company's right not to extend the
Agreement shall be with or without cause, and the Company's exercise of its right not to extend
the Agreement will not necessarily terminate the Executive's employment with the Company.

(c) Certain Definitions.

(i) The "Average Annual Bonus" shall mean the average annual bonus the
Executive received for the three (3) completed fiscal years immediately preceding the Date of
Termination under the Company’s Annual Incentive Plan (“AIP Plan’) and/or the Company’s
Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (““EIC Plan’), provided that the First Year Bonus Target,
shall be used in the average computation for any year in which the Executive was not eligible to
participate in the AIP Plan and /or the EIC Plan for the full fiscal year.

(ii) “Bonus Target” means the annual bonus that the Executive would have received
in a fiscal year under the AIP Plan and/or the EIC Plan, if the target goals had been achieved.

(ii) “First Year Bonus Target” means the Executive’s Bonus Target as of June 30
for the first fiscal year in which he was eligible to participate in the AIP Plan and/or the EIC
Plan.

(BLANK) REV. 8/12/04 10:45 AM

(a) Position. The Company agrees to continue the Executive in its employ, and the
Executive agrees to continue employment with the Company subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement. The Executive shall devote his best efforts and the equivalent of full time
employment to the performance of the services customarily incident to the Executive's current
office and to such other services as may be reasonably requested by the Board. The Company
shall retain full direction and control of the means and methods by which the Executive performs
the above services and of the place(s) at which such services are to be rendered.

(b) Other Activities. Excluding any periods of vacation and sick leave to which the
Executive is entitled, the Executive agrees to devote reasonable attention and time during normal
hours to the business and affairs of the Company, and to the extent necessary to discharge the
responsibilities assigned to the Executive hereunder, to use the Executive's reasonable best
efforts to perform faithfully and efficiently such responsibilities. It shall not be a violation of
this Agreement for the Executive to (A) serve on corporate, civic or charitable boards or
committees, (B) deliver lectures, fulfill speaking engagements or teach at educational institutions
on a part-time basis not to exceed five hours per week in the aggregate and (C) manage personal
investments, so long as such activities do not significantly interfere with the performance of the
Executive's responsibilities as an employee of the Company in accordance with this Agreement.
It is expressly understood and agreed that to the extent that any such activities have been
conducted by the Executive prior to the Effective Date, the continued conduct of such activities
(or the conduct of activities similar in nature and scope thereto) subsequent to the Effective Date
shall not thereafter be deemed to interfere with the performance of the Executive's
responsibilities to the Company.

3. Salary; Incentive Compensation; Benefits; Expenses.
a) Salary. In consideration of the services to be rendered hereunder, including,

without limitation, services to any Affiliated Company, the Executive shall be paid an annual
base salary ("Annual Base Salary") beginning at the level being paid on the effective date,
payable at the times and pursuant to the procedures regularly established, and as they may be
amended, by the Company during the course of this Agreement. The Annual Base Salary shall
be reviewed periodically in accordance with the Company's regular administrative practice for
adjusting salaries of Executive Officers (the Chairman of the Board, the CEO, the President and
other members of the Management Executive Committee). The Company may reduce the
Executive's salary only if the salaries of other Executive Officers of the Company are at the same
time being similarly adjusted and if the percentage reduction in the Executive's salary does not
exceed that of the other Executive Officers.

(b) Annual Incentive Plan; Executive Incentive Compensation Plan; Long Term
Compensation Program. The Executive shall be entitled to participate in the Company's Annual
Incentive Plan (the “AIP Plan”), the Executive Incentive Compensation Plan (the "EIC Plan")
and Stock-Based Long-Term Compensation Program (the "LTC Program") in accordance with
the Company's practice for administering the AIP Plan, the EIC Plan and the LTC Program with
respect to Executive Officers, unless the Company suspends or terminates one or more of the
AIP Plan, the EIC Plan or the LTC Program. For purposes of this Agreement, "LTC Program"
encompasses Stock-Based Awards made to the Executive under the 1987 Long-Term Incentive
Plan, 1996 Stock Incentive Plan or any subsequent stock-based incentive compensation plan.

(c) Benefits. As he becomes eligible therefor, the Company shall provide the
Executive with the right to participate in and to receive benefits from all present and future
welfare benefit plans, practices, policies and programs (including without limitation, medical,

\Ex. 10(viii) - Officer Employment Agmt. Form.doc Page 2 of 10
(BLANK) REV. 8/12/04 10:45 AM

prescription drugs, dental, disability, salary continuance, severance pay, employee life, group
life, accidental death and travel accident insurance plans and programs), all incentive savings
and retirement plans, practices and programs, including without limitation the Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"), and all similar benefits, made available generally to
Executive Officers of the Company. The Executive shall be entitled to annual vacation as
determined in accordance with Company policy, which shall be taken with the prior approval of
the Company. The amount and extent of benefits to which Executive is entitled shall be
governed by each specific benefit plan, as it may be amended from time to time. The Executive
shall also be entitled to the death and disability benefits described in Section 4. The Company
may suspend or terminate any benefit plan described in this Section 3(c).

(d) Expenses. The Company shall reimburse the Executive for reasonable travel and
other business expenses incurred by the Executive in the performance of his duties hereunder in
accordance with the Company's general policies, as they may be amended from time to time
during the course of this Agreement.

4. Termination of Employment.

(a) By Death. The Executive's employment shall terminate automatically upon his
death. The Company shall pay to the Executive's beneficiaries or estate, as appropriate, the
salary to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 3 (a) through the end of the month in which
death occurs. The Company shall also pay the Executive's beneficiaries or estate, as appropriate,
a pro rata portion (through the date of death) of the Executive's target AIP and EIC Plan award
for the fiscal year of his death. After the payments called for in this Section 4(a) are made, the
Company’s obligations hereunder shall terminate. This Section shall not affect entitlement of
the Executive's estate or beneficiaries to death benefits under any benefit plan of the Company.

(b) By Disability. Should the Executive begin to receive benefits under the Company's
Long Term Disability Plan, the Executive's employment may terminate at the Company's option.
If the Company so elects, the Company shall pay the salary to which the Executive is entitled
pursuant to Section 3(a) through the date of termination, and in lieu of any AIP and EIC Plan
award under Section 3(b) for the fiscal year in which termination occurs, the Company shall pay
the Executive a pro rata portion (through the termination date) of the Executive's target AIP and
EIC Plan award for the fiscal year of the termination. Thereafter the Company's obligations
hereunder shall terminate.

(c) By Company For Cause. The Company may terminate the Executive's employment
for Cause (as defined below) at any time without notice and without liability. The Company
shall pay the Executive the salary to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 3(a) through the end
of the day upon which termination occurs, and thereafter the Company's obligations hereunder
shall terminate. The Executive shall not be entitled to any AIP and EIC Plan award pursuant to
Section 3(b) for the fiscal year in which termination occurs. Termination shall be for Cause if:

(i) the Executive willfully neglects significant duties he is required to perform or
willfully violates material Company policy, and, after being warned in writing, continues to
neglect such duties or continues to violate the specified Company policy;

(ii) the Executive commits a material act of dishonesty, fraud, misrepresentation or
other act of moral turpitude;

(iii) the Executive exhibits gross negligence in the course of employment;

\Ex. 10(viii) - Officer Employment Agmt. Form.doc Page 3 of 10
(BLANK) REV. 8/12/04 10:45 AM

(iv) the Executive fails to obey a lawful direction of the Board of Directors; or

(v) the Executive acts in any other manner inconsistent with the Company’s best
interests and values.

(d) By the Executive or the Company At Will.

(i) Termination by the Company. The Company may, at any time, terminate the
Executive's employment without Cause. If the Company does so, the severance payment
provisions of Section 6 shall apply and the Company shall have no additional liability. The
Executive hereby agrees that the Company may dismiss him under this Section 4(d)(i) without
regard (A) to any general or specific policies (whether written or oral) of the Company relating
to the employment or termination of its employees, or (B) to any statements made to the
Executive, whether made orally or contained in any document, pertaining to the Executive's
relationship with the Company. Nothing in this Section 4(d)(i) shall prevent the Company from
exercising its right under Section 4(c) to terminate the Executive's employment for Cause, and
such a termination (regardless of when made) shall not give rise to damages under Section 6.

(ii) Termination by the Executive. Except in the case of Retirement as provided in
Section 4(d)(iii), the Executive may, upon giving at least 10 business days' written notice to the
Company, terminate his employment, without liability, for any reason. If the Executive
terminates his employment pursuant to this Section 4(d)(ii), the Company shall pay the
Executive the salary to which he is entitled pursuant to Section 3(a) through the end of the 10
business days notice period, and thereafter the Company's obligations hereunder shall terminate.
The Executive shall not be entitled to any AIP and EIC Plan award pursuant to Section 3(b) for
the fiscal year in which he terminates.

(iii) The Executive's Retirement. If the Executive is eligible to begin receiving
benefits pursuant to the SERP, then upon giving at least three month's written notice to the
Company of his election to do so, the Executive may terminate his employment and begin
receiving SERP benefits. Such a termination constitutes "Retirement" for purposes of this
Agreement. Upon the Executive's Retirement, the Company shall pay the Executive the salary to
which he is entitled pursuant to Section 3(a) through the last day of his employment. In addition,
the Executive shall be entitled to receive a pro rata portion calculated upon the proportion of the
fiscal year during which the Executive was employed of the Executive's AIP and/or EIC Plan
award for the fiscal year of his Retirement. The award will be paid after the close of the fiscal
year at the same time that AIP and EIC Plan award payments are made to employed Executives.
The award will be a percentage of the Executive's AIP and/or EIC Plan target award for that
fiscal year based upon the application of the overall corporate results factor and the division
and/or functional results factor, if applicable, of the AIP and/or EIC Plan award calculation
matrix. The award will not be based on any personal objectives factor; thus, the individual
modifier to be applied to the corporate and business and/or functional results will be calculated
at 100%.

(e) Termination Obligations.

(i) The Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that all personal property and
equipment furnished to or prepared by the Executive in the course of or incident to his
employment, belong to the Company and shall, if physically returnable, be promptly returned to
the Company upon termination of his employment. "Personal property" includes, without
limitation, all books, manuals, records, reports, notes, contracts, lists, blueprints, and other
documents, computer media or materials, or copies thereof, and Proprietary Information (as

\Ex. 10(viii) - Officer Employment Agmt. Form.doc Page 4 of 10
(BLANK) REV. 8/12/04 10:45 AM

defined below). Following termination, the Executive will not retain any written or other
tangible material containing any Proprietary Information.

(ii) Upon termination of his employment, the Executive shall be deemed to have
resigned from all offices and directorships then held with the Company or any Affiliated

Company, and will execute a letter of resignation if requested.

(iii) The Executive's obligations under Sections 4(e), 5, 7 and 14 shall survive
termination of his employment and the expiration of this Agreement.

5. Post Termination Obligations.

(a) Proprietary Information Defined. "Proprietary Information" is all information and
any idea in whatever form, tangible or intangible, pertaining in any manner to the business of the
Company or any Affiliated Company, or to its clients, consultants, or business associates, unless:
(i) the information is or becomes publicly known through lawful means; (ii) the information was
rightfully in the Executive's possession or part of his general knowledge prior to his employment
by the Company; or (iii) the information is disclosed to the Executive without confidential or
proprietary restriction by a third party who rightfully possesses the information (without
confidential or proprietary restriction) and did not learn of it, directly or indirectly, from the
Company.

(b) General Restrictions on Use of Proprietary Information. The Executive agrees to
hold all Proprietary Information in strict confidence and trust for the sole benefit of the Company
and not to, directly or indirectly, disclose, use, copy, publish, summarize, or remove from
Company's premises any Proprietary Information (or remove from the premises any other
property of the Company), except (i) during his employment to the extent necessary to carry out
the Executive's responsibilities under this Agreement, and (ii) after termination of his
employment as specifically authorized in writing by the Board.

(c) Non-Solicitation and Non-Raiding. To forestall the disclosure or use of Proprietary
Information in breach of Section 5(b), and in consideration of this Agreement, Executive agrees
that for a period of two years after termination of his employment, he shall not, for himself or
any third party, directly or indirectly (i) divert or attempt to divert from the Company (or any
Affiliated Company) any business of any kind in which it is engaged, including, without
limitation, the solicitation of its customers as to products which are directly competitive with
products sold by the Company at the time of the Executive's termination, or interference with
any of its suppliers or customers, or (ii) solicit for employment any person employed by the
Company, or by any Affiliated Company, during the period of such person's employment and for
a period of one year after the termination of such person's employment with the Company.

(d) Contacts with the Press. Following termination, the Executive will continue to
abide by the Company's policy that prohibits discussing any aspect of Company business with
representatives of the press without first obtaining the permission of the Company's Public
Relations Department.

(e) Remedies. Nothing in this Section 5 is intended to limit any remedy of the
Company under the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act (California Civil Code Section 3426),
or otherwise available under law.

6. Severance Payments; Requirement of Mitigation; Release.

\Ex. 10(viii) - Officer Employment Agmt. Form.doc Page 5 of 10
(BLANK) REV. 8/12/04 10:45 AM

(a) Severance Payments. The Company and the Executive acknowledge that it would
be impractical or extremely difficult to fix the Executive's actual damages in the case of
termination at will by the Company pursuant to Section 4(d)(i). Therefore, in the event of such a
termination and notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in exchange for and in
consideration of Executive's execution and non-revocation of a General Release ("Release") in a
form substantially equivalent to the attached Exhibit, and subject to the mitigation provisions of
Section 6(b), the Executive shall be entitled to severance payments made up of the following
components:

(i) Salary Component.

Payment, promptly after termination, of a lump sum amount equal to salary, at a
monthly rate equal to the highest monthly base salary rate in effect during the twelve month
period preceding the termination of employment times the number of months in the remaining
term of this Agreement as determined in Sections 1(a)(i) or (iii) had the termination not
occurred, or until the Executive's death if that occurs first (the "Severance Payment Period").

(ii) AIP and EIC Plan Components.

(A) Payment, promptly after termination, of a lump sum amount equal to
75% of his Average Annual Bonus, prorated to the date of termination.

(B) In addition, payment, promptly after termination, of a lump sum
amount equal to 75% of the Executive's Average Annual Bonus times the number of months

remaining in the Severance Payment Period divided by twelve (12).

(iii) Medical/Dental Plans Component.

(A) Continuation for the Severance Payment Period on the same basis as
an employee of the Company of the right to participate in any Medical and/or Dental Benefit
Plans as and if offered by the Company to its salaried employees. The Executive shall not
participate in any other Company sponsored welfare benefit plans after the termination of
employment.

(B) In addition, if at the end of the Severance Payment Period the
Executive will be age 55 or older and at least 10 years will have passed since the beginning of
the Executive's last period of employment with the Company, continuation of the right to
participate in Medical and/or Dental Plans as and if offered to former employees whose
employment terminated at or after age 55 with ten or more years of service on the same terms
and conditions as for such former employees including premium contributions from the
Executive as in effect from time to time. Such right to participate shall apply from the time such
coverage would otherwise terminate pursuant to (iii)(a) and shall continue until the Executive
attains age 65; thereafter the Executive may participate in the Company's Retiree Health Plan as
and if it may exist from time to time in the future, if he would be eligible to participate pursuant
to the terms of that Plan.

(iv) SERP Component.

Continuation of benefit credits and service accruals under the SERP during the
Severance Payment Period, if, at the end of that period and taking into account such service
accruals the Executive will be age 55 or older and will be credited with ten or more years of
service under the SERP. During this period, benefit credits shall be based on the compensation

\Ex. 10(viii) - Officer Employment Agmt. Form.doc Page 6 of 10
(BLANK) REV. 8/12/04 10:45 AM

required to be paid under (i) and (ii)(A) and (B), above, without regard to any adjustment made
pursuant to paragraph 6(b) below.

(v) LTC Program Component.

(A) If the Executive qualifies for continuation of benefit credits and service
accruals under the SERP pursuant to (iv) above, then for purposes of the LTC Programs his
termination of employment will be deemed to be a Termination of Employment Due to
Retirement occurring at the end of the Severance Payment Period if the Executive irrevocably
elects prior to the beginning of the Severance Payment Period to begin retirement benefits under
the Company's Pension Plan and the SERP at the conclusion of the Severance Payment Period.
If he does not so elect, all LTC Program awards which remain at the date of termination will be
treated pursuant to subsection (B) below.

(B) If the Executive does not qualify for continuation of benefit credits and
service accruals under the SERP pursuant to (iv) above, or does not make the election described
in Section 6(a)(v)(A), then for purposes of all LTC Program awards, he will be deemed to have
terminated employment on the day prior to the beginning of the Severance Payment Period.
Whether any LTC Program award is forfeited in such a case will be determined by the terms of
the award and the plan pursuant to which it was awarded.

(vi) Automobile Component.

The Executive shall be entitled to purchase the Company-leased automobile, if
any, being used by the Executive prior to termination at the "buyout amount" specified by the
vehicle's lessor.

The parties acknowledge that the amounts and benefits provided in (i) through (vi) above
constitute a reasonable estimate of and compensation for any damages the Executive may suffer
as the result of his termination of employment under this Agreement.

If the Executive does not execute, or having executed, effectively revokes the Release, the
Company will not be obligated to provide any benefits or payments of any kind to the Executive.

(b) Coordination of Benefits. The Executive's medical and dental benefit coverage
under 6(a)(iii)(A) and/or (B) shall be secondary to medical and/or dental coverage provided to
the Executive by a subsequent employer and the Executive will make every good faith effort to
participate in any such coverage. For any period during which the Executive does not make such
a good faith effort the Executive's medical and dental plan coverage under 6(a)(ili)(A) and/or (B)
shall be completely suspended. If medical and dental benefit coverage ceases to be provided by
the subsequent employer, Executive may have his 6(a)(iii)(A) and/or (B) coverage from the
Company become his primary coverage again. The Severance Payment Period shall not be
subtracted from the period of months for which the Executive is eligible for benefits under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985.

(c) Lack of Participation in Qualified Plans. Upon termination of employment the
Executive shall cease to participate in any qualified benefit plan maintained by the Company,
such as the Pension Plan and the 401(k) Plan, and the Executive shall also cease to participate in
any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Company, except as otherwise provided in (a)(iii)
above or under the terms of such plan. No employee or employer contributions will be made to
any qualified benefit plan based on any bonus paid after the termination of the Executive's
employment.

GENERAL RELEASE

This document is an important one. You should review it carefully and, if
you agree to it, sign at the end on the line indicated.

You have 21 days to sign this Release, during which time you are advised to
consult with an attorney regarding its terms.

After signing this Release, you have seven days to revoke it. Revocation
should be made in writing and delivered so that it is received by the
Corporate Secretary of The Clorox Company, 1221 Broadway, Oakland, CA
94612 no later than 4:30 p.m. on the seventh day after signing this Release.
If you do revoke this Release within that time frame, you will have no rights
under it. This Release shall not become effective or enforceable until the
seven day revocation period has expired.

The agreement for payment of consideration in paragraph 2 will not become
effective until the seven day revocation period has passed.

This GENERAL RELEASE is entered into between The Clorox Company

(hereinafter referred to as "Employer") and (hereinafter referred to as

"Employee"). Employer and Employee agree as follows:

1. Employee's regular employment with Employer will terminate as of ;
20__. Employee is ineligible for reemployment or reinstatement with Employer.

2. Upon Employee's acceptance of the terms set forth herein, the Employer agrees to
provide the Employee with compensation and benefits set forth in Section 6 of the Employment

Agreement between the Employee and the Employer effective as of ,20_,

a copy of which is attached as the first Exhibit to this General Release. A complete description
of those benefits is attached as the second Exhibit to this General Release.

3(a) In consideration of the Employer providing Employee this compensation, Employee
and Employee's heirs, assignees and agents agree to release the Employer, all affiliated
companies, agents and employees and each of their successors and assigns (hereinafter referred
to as "Releasees") fully and finally from any claims, liabilities, demands or causes of action
which Employee may have or claim to have against the Releasees at present or in the future,
except claims for vested benefits, if any. The claims released may include, but are not
limited to, any tax obligations as a result of the
payment of consideration referred to in paragraph 2, and claims arising under federal, state or
local laws prohibiting discrimination in employment, including the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act (ADEA) or claims growing out of any legal restrictions on the Employer's right
to terminate its employees. Claims of discrimination, wrongful
termination, age discrimination, and any claims other than for vested benefits are hereby

released.

\Ex. 10(viii) - Officer Employment Agmt. Form.doc Page 11 of 10
(BLANK) REV. 8/12/04 10:45 AM

(b) By signing this document, Employee agrees not to file a lawsuit to assert such
claims. Employee also agrees that if Employee breaches this provision, Employee will be liable
for all costs and attorneys' fees incurred by any Releasee resulting from such action.

4. By signing this document, Employee is also expressly waiving the provisions of

California Civil Code section 1542, which provides as follows:

"A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or
suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known
by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

By signing this document, Employee agrees and understands that Employee is
releasing unknown as well as known claims related to Employee's employment in exchange for
the compensation set forth above.

5. Employee agrees to maintain in complete confidence the terms of this Release,
except as it may be necessary to comply with a legally compelled request for information. It is
agreed since confidentiality of this Release is of the essence, damages for violation being
impossible to assess with precision, that $10,000 is a fair estimate of the damage caused by each
disclosure and is agreed to as the measure of damages for each violation.

6. | Employee agrees to indemnify and hold Employer harmless from and against any tax
obligations for which Employee may become liable as a result of this Release and/or payments
made pursuant to the Employment Agreement, other than tax obligations of the
