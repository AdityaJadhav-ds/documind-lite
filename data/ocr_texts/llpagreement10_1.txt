Partnership, such notice to take effect immediately or, if later, at such date specified in the

the effect of transferring the economic benefits and/or burdens of the ownership of the interests
in the Partnership to a third party or (v) other rights or options to buy or sell interests in the
Partnership or securities thereof).

Any Member may transfer all, but not part only, of its interest in the Partnership to a wholly-
owned subsidiary of RBS (in the case of RBS) or Sempra Energy (in the case of SG or SETI)
(whether by sale, assignment or otherwise or in connection with any merger, consolidation or
amalgamation of, with or into such Member) without the consent of any other Member;
provided, however, that no transfer under this Clause 4.7 shall be permitted if, solely as a
result of such transfer, the Partnership would become subject to and bound by any laws, rules,
regulations, directives, treaties, judgements, decrees or orders of any governmental or
regulatory authority that would have an adverse effect on the Partnership’s ability to conduct
the Business or would result in a more-than-insignificant increase in the Taxes owed by the
Partnership or any of the non-transferring Members. No transfer under this Clause 4.7 shall be
effective unless:

4.7.1 the transferor and transferee perform such actions as are required by Clause 4.8; and

4.7.2 the transferee undertakes to the Partnership that if it is proposed that the transferee
should cease to be a subsidiary of RBS or Sempra Energy (as the case may be), then

therewith) in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall become a Member of the
Partnership and succeed to all of the rights and obligations of such Member, and the
Partnership shall continue to exist under this Agreement mutatis mutandis; provided, however,
that no such Transfer shall be effective unless:

transfer prior to or simultaneously with the effectiveness of such transfer;

4.8.2 the transferee delivers to the Board a duly executed Accession Deed; and

Sempra Member makes a Contribution pursuant to this Clause 5.5.1, the RBS
Members shall have the right to make a Contribution to the Partnership of equal value.

Within thirty (30) days following the delivery of Accounts to the Members pursuant to
Clause 6.2.3(i), if the Total FSA Regulatory Capital for the most recently ended
Financial Year is greater than or equal to $2,450,000,000 and the Sempra Adjusted
Contribution Amount is less than $1,500,000,000, the Sempra Members shall have the
right, but not an obligation, to make cash Contributions to the Partnership in such
amounts as they may determine in their discretion; provided that no amount
Contributed by the Sempra Members pursuant to this Clause 5.5.2 shall exceed the
lesser of (i)an amount equal to $1,500,000,000 minus the Sempra Adjusted
Contribution Amount on the date of such Contribution (before giving effect to such
Contribution) and (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the amount by which the Total FSA
Regulatory Capital for the most recently ended Financial Year exceeds
$2,450,000,000. At any time within twenty (20) Business Days of the date on which
any Sempra Member makes a Contribution pursuant to this Clause 5.5.2, the RBS
Member shall have the right to make a Contribution to the Partnership of equal value.

Upon receipt by the Partnership of a Contribution referred to in Clause 5.5.1 or 5.5.2
from the Sempra Member Group, the SG Adjusted Contribution Amount or the SETI
Adjusted Contribution Amount, as applicable, shall be increased by an amount equal to
the amount of such Contribution. Upon receipt by the Partnership of a Contribution
referred to in Clause 5.5.1 or 5.5.2 from the RBS Member, the RBS Adjusted
Contribution Amount shall be increased by an amount equal to the amount of such
Contribution.

Rebalancing of Adjusted Contribution Amounts

5.6.1

5.6.2

5.6.3

The Board shall, on an annual basis, review the relative performance and capital needs
of the US Business and the Non-US Business.

If the Board determines that the Non-US Business has, during the relevant year,
contracted relative to growing US Business, the Board may approve that the
Partnership shall distribute to SETI an amount equal to the capital that the Board
determines to be unnecessary in the operation of the Non-US Business, and the SETI
Adjusted Contribution Amount shall be reduced by such amount. If the Partnership
makes such a distribution, SG shall simultaneously make a cash Contribution to the
Partnership in the same amount, and the SG Adjusted Contribution Amount shall be
increased by such amount.

If the Board determines that the US Business has, during the relevant year, contracted
relative to growing Non-US Business, the Board may approve that the Partnership shall
distribute to SG an amount equal to the capital that the Board determines to be
unnecessary in the operation of the US Business, and the SG Adjusted Contribution
Amount shall be reduced by such amount. If the Partnership makes such a
distribution, SETI shall simultaneously make a cash Contribution to the Partnership in
the same amount, and the SETI Adjusted Contribution Amount shall be increased by
such amount.

the date of the Closing. Once prepared, the Partnership shall promptly notify the
Sempra Members of such Internal Audit Plan, and such Members shall have a period

member of the SET Group; provided that such Member shall be permitted to so
authorise its independent accountants or auditors not more frequently than
once every two years or more frequently if such Member has a reasonable
basis to believe that a material error exists in the financial statements of the
SET Group.

Each Member and its authorised representatives (including, with respect to clause (iv),
its independent accountants or auditors) shall comply with reasonable safety and
security instructions from the Partnership and undertake reasonable efforts to minimise
disruption to the SET Group. Any Member conducting such an examination shall pay
any out of pocket expenses incurred by such Member in connection therewith.

The Partnership shall, and shall cause each of the other members of the SET Group to,

record and account, in which entries in conformity with IFRS and otherwise in
compliance with Applicable Law shall be made of all dealings and financial transactions
and the assets and business of the Partnership and each other member of the SET
Group in relation to their respective businesses and activities. Such books and records
shall comply in all material respects with any and all applicable tax and legal
requirements of the various jurisdictions in which the Partnership operates and shall
include such information and be in such form as is necessary to compute the
Partnership and Members’ liability for income and other taxes (taking into account any
transfer pricing requirements) in each such jurisdiction. The Partnership shall cause
such books of record and account, the Accounts, all financial statements prepared in
accordance with Clause 6.2 and all other financial reports and calculations to be
denominated in Dollars, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law or IFRS.

The Partnership shall, and shall cause each other member of the SET Group to,
subject to the requirements of Clause 17, furnish to each Member such documents,
certificates and other information, and provide reasonable access to management, as
such Member may reasonably request for purposes of complying with Applicable Laws,
including laws regulating U.S. publicly traded companies and companies that are
Associated Companies with respect to regulated utilities, and the Affiliate Conduct
Rules and Plans.

RBS shall, and shall cause each of its Associated Companies to, subject to the
requirements of Clause 17, furnish to each Member such documents, certificates and
other information, and provide reasonable access to management, as such Member
may reasonably require (and has requested in writing) for purposes of complying with
Applicable Laws, including laws regulating U.S. publicly traded companies, and the
Affiliate Conduct Rules and Plans; provided that the obligations of RBS under this
Clause 6.3.5 shall be limited to (i) documents, certificates and other information
pertaining to the Business or otherwise reasonably relating to the Partnership and its
Associated Companies and (ii) communication with members of management that
pertains to the Business or otherwise reasonably relates to the SET Group.

The Sempra Members shall, and shall cause each of their Associated Companies,

26

access to management, as the Partnership or such Member may reasonably require
(and has requested in writing) for purposes of complying with Applicable Laws,
including laws regulating U.S. publicly traded companies, and the Affiliate Conduct
Rules and Plans; provided that the obligations of the Sempra Members under this
Clause 6.3.6 shall be limited to (i) documents, certificates and other information
pertaining to the Business or otherwise reasonably relating to the Partnership and its
Associated Companies and (ii) communication with members of management that
pertains to the Business or otherwise reasonably relates to the SET Group.

with Clause 6.3.1 or 6.3.2, any Member believes that any financial statement or report
prepared in connection with Clause 6.2.1, 6.2.2 or 6.2.3 should be amended, such
Member shall promptly notify the other Members and the Partnership. Upon receipt of
such notice, the Partnership shall convene an audit committee consisting of one RBS
Director and one Sempra Director, and the committee shall determine whether to
amend such financial statement or report. If the audit committee is unable to agree on
a determination, the Auditors shall be consulted, and the determination of the Auditors
shall be binding on the Members with respect to the noticed matter.

6.3.8 The Designated Members shall select the Auditors of the Partnership from among the
“big four” international accounting firms or such firms as are then remaining at the time
of such selection. The Auditors so chosen may also act as independent auditor of one
or more of the Members.

Distributions
Calculation of Allocation Percentages

Within two (2) weeks from completion of the audit of the Accounts in any Financial Year and
provided that the Accounts show an Adjusted Global Net Income for such Financial Year, the
Partnership shall calculate the Allocation Percentages for that Financial Year (the date of such
calculation, the “Allocation Percentage Calculation Date”). For the purposes of calculating
the Allocation Percentages for any Financial Year, the Adjusted Global Net Income, if any, for
that Financial Year shall be allocated notionally as between the RBS Member Group and the
Sempra Member Group in the following priority to the extent of such available income:

7.1.1 first, to the Sempra Member Group, the Sempra Member Group’s Unallocated
Preferred Return, if any, as provided in Clause 7.6.1;

7.1.3. third, to the RBS Member Group, the RBS Member Group’s Unallocated Preferred
Return, if any, as provided in Clause 7.6.2;

27

7.2

7.3

717

718

seventh, to the Sempra Member Group, the Sempra Member Group’s Allocation of
Tranche 2; and

eighth, to the RBS Member Group, the RBS Member Group’s Allocation of Tranche 2.

Application of Allocation Percentages and Payment of Distributions

In respect of each Financial Year, following the calculation of the Allocation Percentages in
accordance with Clause 7.1:

7.2.1

7.2.2

Simultaneously, (i) the Sempra Allocation Percentage shall be applied to the US Net
Income for such Financial Year and, subject to the approval of the Board required by
Clause 7.5 and to Clauses 7.3, 7.4 and 9, such amount shall be distributed by the
Partnership to SG and (ii) the RBS Allocation Percentage shall be applied to the US
Net Income for such Financial year and, subject to the approval of the Board required
by Clause 7.5 and to Clauses 7.3, 7.4 and 9, such amount shall be distributed by the
Partnership to RBS; and

Simultaneously, (i) the Sempra Allocation Percentage shall be applied to the Non-US
Net Income for such Financial Year and, subject to the approval of the Board required
by Clause 7.5 and to Clauses 7.3, 7.4 and 9, such amount shall be distributed by the
Partnership to SETI and (ii) the RBS Allocation Percentage shall be applied to the Non-
US Net Income for such Financial Year and, subject to the approval of the Board
required by Clause 7.5 and to Clauses 7.3, 7.4 and 9, such amount shall be distributed

Payment of Out of Pocket and Tax Damages

7.3.1

7.3.2

Where Out of Pocket and Tax Damages are payable by an Indemnifying Person to an
Indemnified Person pursuant to Article IX of the Master Formation and Equity Interest
Purchase Agreement, the Indemnifying Person shall have the right to elect, by
irrevocable notice in writing to the Partnership, for the relevant Out of Pocket and Tax
Damages, to the extent not reasonably likely to exceed the amount of distributions
payable to the Indemnifying Person or its Associated Companies on the next
succeeding date on which distributions are paid pursuant to Clause 7.2, to be set off
against such distributions and for the amount so set off to be distributed by the
Partnership to the nominated Sempra Member (where the Indemnified Person is a
member of the Sempra Group) or to a nominated member of the RBS Member Group
(where the Indemnified Person is a member of the RBS Group other than the
Partnership) or applied by the Partnership in accordance with Clause 7.3.4 (where the
Indemnified Person is the Partnership). On the next date on which distributions are
paid pursuant to Clause 7.2 following receipt of such irrevocable notice by the
Partnership, the amounts shall be set off as set forth in such notice and the amount so
set off shall be deemed for all other purposes under this Agreement to have been
distributed to the Indemnifying Person. No such election to set off Out of Pocket and
Tax Damages against distributions shall affect the obligations of the Indemnifying
Person under the Master Formation and Equity Interest Purchase Agreement to pay
Out of Pocket and Tax Damages except to the extent such setoff actually occurs.

If (a) a claim for Out of Pocket and Tax Damages has been made pursuant to Article IX
of the Master Formation and Equity Interest Purchase Agreement and the amount of
such Out of Pocket and Tax Damages is reasonably certain and (b) the Indemnifying

28

7.3.3

Person is no longer contesting in good faith such claim for Out of Pocket and Tax
Damages or a Governmental Body has issued a binding, final and non-appealable
order, writ or similar instrument (each an “Order”) with respect to such claim for Out of
Pocket and Tax Damages, then, in each case, on the next succeeding date on which
distributions are paid, the Partnership shall set off the relevant Out of Pocket and Tax
Damages against the distributions otherwise payable to the Indemnifying Person or its
Associated Companies pursuant to Clause 7.2, and the amount so set off shall be
distributed by the Partnership to the nominated Sempra Member (where the
Indemnified Person is a member of the Sempra Group) or to a nominated member of
the RBS Member Group (where the Indemnified Person is a member of the RBS Group
other than the Partnership) or applied by the Partnership in accordance with
Clause 7.3.4 (where the Indemnified Person is the Partnership). The amount so set off
shall be deemed for all other purposes under this Agreement to have been distributed
to the Indemnifying Person.

If (a) a claim for Out of Pocket and Tax Damages has been made pursuant to Article IX
of the Master Formation and Equity Interest Purchase Agreement (other than a claim
covered by Clauses 7.3.1 or 7.3.2) and remains unsatisfied prior to a distribution date,
(b) the Indemnifying Person has suffered a Ratings Trigger and (c) the Indemnified
Person is complying, to the extent applicable, with Section 10.5 of the Master
Formation and Equity Interest Purchase Agreement, then:

(i) the Partnership shall withhold from the next distribution otherwise payable to
the Indemnifying Person pursuant to Clause 7.2 the lesser of (x) the amount of
the Out of Pocket and Tax Damages remaining unsatisfied in respect of such
claim and (y)the amount otherwise required to be distributed to the
Indemnifying Person (the “Escrowed Amount’); and

(ii) the Escrowed Amount with respect to any claim for Out of Pocket and Tax
Damages shall be distributed after the Indemnifying Person is no longer
contesting in good faith such claim for Out of Pocket and Tax Damages or an
Order has been entered with respect to such claim: (a) in full to the
Indemnifying Person, if the Indemnifying Person is not obligated to pay any
such Out of Pocket and Tax Damages or pays such Out of Pocket and Tax
Damages in full, (b) in full to the Indemnified Person, if the Out of Pocket and
Tax Damages payable to the Indemnified Person are greater than or equal to
the Escrowed Amount or (c) if the Out of Pocket and Tax Damages payable to
the Indemnified Person are less than the Escrowed Amount, (x) first, to the
Indemnified Person, an amount equal to such Out of Pocket and Tax Damages
and (y) second, to the Indemnifying Person, an amount equal to the remaining
Escrowed Amount with respect to such Out of Pocket and Tax Damages after
the amounts in clause (x) above are distributed (in each case, such amounts
shall be distributed together with interest accrued thereon at an annual rate of
nine percent (9%), compounded annually and calculated on the basis of a 365
day year and the actual number of days elapsed, from and including the date of
such withholding to but excluding the date of distribution of such Escrowed
Amount); provided that any amounts that would be distributed to the
partnership pursuant to this Clause 7.3.3 (inclusive of accrued interest) shall be
retained by the Partnership.

29

7.4

7.3.4

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, where the Partnership is the
Indemnified Person, if any Out of Pocket and Tax Damages are paid, set off against
distributions pursuant to Clause 7.3.1 or released from escrow pursuant to
Clause 7.3.3(ii)(b) or (c)(x) in a Financial Year (the “current Financial Year’) later than
the Financial Year in which the Partnership recorded charges arising from such Out of
Pocket and Tax Damages (the “earlier Financial Year’), an amount equal to the
amount so paid, set off or released shall be applied pro forma to the post-Tax
consolidated income of the SET Group (determined in accordance with the definition of
Adjusted Gross Net Income) in respect of the earlier Financial Year and the Allocation
Percentages and related distributions to Members for such year shall be calculated pro
forma (including for purposes of this calculation, adjustments in respect of
compensation expense for the current Financial Year that are attributable to the
activities that resulted in the Out of Pocket and Tax Damages in the earlier Financial
Year that was payable on a basis related to performance in the earlier Financial Year).
If such pro forma calculation results in an increase in distributions payable to any
Member in respect of the earlier Financial Year, the Partnership shall, subject to the
approval of the Board required by Clause 7.5 and to Clauses 7.4 and 9, cause an
amount equal to such increase, promptly after its identification, to be distributed in the
form of a special distribution, payable to such Members in the current Financial Year in
such amounts determined on the basis of the pro forma calculations (and such
payments and the offset amounts shall be disregarded in the calculation of Adjusted
Global Net Income or Adjusted Global Net Loss for the current Financial Year). If such
pro forma calculation results in a reduction in Adjusted Global Net Loss in respect of
the earlier Financial Year, the applicable Adjusted Contribution Amounts in the
aggregate shall be increased by the amount of such reduction in the manner set out in
Clause 8.1 as applied to the attribution of Net Losses.

Maximum Entitlements

7.41

7.4.2

7.43

Where in any Financial Year there is Adjusted Global Net Income but there is either a
US Net Loss or a Non-US Net Loss, the Partnership shall, subject to Clause 9, only
distribute the Sempra Maximum Entitlement to SG (in the case of a Non-US Net Loss)
or the Sempra Maximum Entitlement to SETI (in the case of a US Net Loss), and shall,
subject to Clause 9, only distribute the RBS Maximum Entitlement to RBS.

Where in any Financial Year there is Adjusted Global Net Income but there is either a
US Net Loss or a Non-US Net Loss, then an amount equal to the product of the
Sempra Allocation Percentage and the US Net Loss or the Non-US Net Loss (as
appropriate) shall be deducted from the SG Adjusted Contribution Amount (in the case
of a US Net Loss) or from the SETI Adjusted Contribution Amount (in the case of a
Non-US Net Loss).

Where in any Financial Year there is Adjusted Global Net Income but there is either a
US Net Loss or a Non-US Net Loss, then an amount equal to the product of the
Sempra Allocation Percentage and the US Net Loss or the Non-US Net Loss (as
appropriate) shall be added to the SG Adjusted Contribution Amount (in the case of a
Non-US Net Loss) or to the SETI Adjusted Contribution Amount (in the case of a US
Net Loss).

30

7.5

7.6

7.7

Board approval for distributions

7.5.1

7.5.2

7.5.3

The payment of distributions to Members shall be subject to a resolution of the Board
approving the relevant distribution.

The parties intend that the Partnership will distribute, as soon as practicable following
the Allocation Percentage Calculation Date and in accordance with Clause 7.2, all
Adjusted Global Net Income for such Financial Year.

The parties intend that the Partnership will distribute the amounts described in
Clause 7.7.1 at the times set forth therein. Prior to the end of each Financial Year, the
Board shall consider including provisions for such distributions in the budget for the
following Financial Year, and if the Board determines to make such budget provisions,
such distributions shall be made in such following Financial Year without further
approval of the Board; provided that the Board may, at any time prior to the making of
any such distribution, revoke any prior authorization for such distribution. If, with
respect to any Financial Year, the Board has made provisions in the budget for the
distributions described in Clause 7.7.1, any distribution during such Financial Year
under such Clause in excess of the amount so budgeted shall require the approval of
the Board in accordance with Clause 7.5.1.

Preferred Return

7.6.1

7.6.2

To the extent that, in any Financial Year, the Sempra Member Group’s Unallocated
Preferred Return is greater than zero, such Sempra Member Group’s Unallocated
Preferred Return shall be applied in the calculation of the Allocation Percentages in
accordance with Clause 7.1.1 in such Financial Year.

To the extent that, in any Financial Year, the RBS Member Group’s Unallocated
Preferred Return is greater than zero, such RBS Member Group’s Unallocated
Preferred Return shall be applied in the calculation of the Allocation Percentages in
accordance with Clause 7.1.3 in such Financial Year.

Tax Payment Distributions

7.7.1

7.7.2

Subject to Clause 7.5, distributions shall be made to the US Member and the Non-US
Members on a quarterly basis, to be made, for each Financial Quarter, no later than
one (1) week before any estimated tax payment is due by SG, in an aggregate amount
determined by multiplying the estimated net income attributable to the US Business for
that Financial Quarter (in the case of each of the US Member and RBS) and the
estimated net income attributable to the Non-US Business for that Financial Quarter (in
the case of the Non-US Member and RBS) by an assumed effective tax rate
reasonably determined by the Board. Such effective tax rate will be the highest of the
marginal tax rates of any of RBS, SG and SETI for such Financial Year, calculated by
taking into account all applicable U.S. federal, state, local and foreign statutory tax
rates for each such Member.

Any amounts distributed to a Member pursuant to this Clause 7.7 in respect of any
quarter will be treated as if such amounts had been distributed to such Member
pursuant to Clause 7.2 for the Financial Year in which such quarter occurs, and thus
will reduce, dollar for dollar, the amounts otherwise distributable to such Member
pursuant to Clause 7.2.

31

7.8

7.7.3

7.7.4

If the aggregate amount distributed to any Member under this Clause 7.7 during any
Financial Year exceeds the amount (determined without regard to Clause 7.5) to be
distributed to such Member under Clause 7.2 in respect of such Financial Year, such
Member shall promptly repay such excess to the Partnership.

If, in respect of any Financial Quarter, the Partnership fails to make any distribution to
any Sempra Member under Clause 7.7.1 on or prior to the date required therein and
such Sempra Member is required to make an estimated tax payment, the amount of
such estimated tax payment shall be deemed a “Sempra Undistributed Tax
Payment” from the last day of such Financial Quarter until the earlier of (i) the Year
End Date of the Financial Year in which such Financial Quarter occurs and (ii) the date
on which such distribution is made to the relevant Sempra Member.

Special Distributions

7.8.1

7.8.2

7.8.3

Whenever any member of the SET Group receives any refund of Taxes that have not
been taken into account in the Final Balance Sheet attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or attributable to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on the date of the
Closing, the cash amount of the refund shall be distributed by the Partnership to SG (in
the case of a refund of Taxes attributable to the US Business) or to SETI (in the case of
a refund of Taxes attributable to the Non-US Business), within one (1) week from
completion of the audit of the Accounts in any Financial Year, in each case net of all
Taxes, costs and other expenses incurred as a result of the receipt of, or payment or
distribution of, such refund.

Whenever any member of the SET Group receives any amount attributable to the
resolution of any UK tax refund litigation (including, for the avoidance of doubt,
advance corporation tax matters) attributable to a dispute over Taxes attributable to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period or attributable to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on
the date of the Closing, the amount received in excess of the amount reflected on the
Final Balance Sheet for such litigation shall be distributed by the Partnership to SG (in
the case of an amount attributable to the US Business) or to SETI (in the case of an
amount attributable to the Non-US Business), within one (1) week from completion of
the audit of the Accounts in any Financial Year, in each case, net of all Taxes, costs and
other expenses incurred by RBS or the Partnership (but offset by any Tax benefit to
which RBS or the Partnership is or will become entitled as a result) as a result of the
receipt of, or payment or distribution of, such refund.

If there is any gain recognised under U.S. federal income tax law by any member of the
Sempra Group on a sale to the Partnership (whether deemed or otherwise) of any
intangible attributable to the SET Business in connection with the transactions
undertaken pursuant to the Master Formation and Equity Interest Purchase Agreement
(other than any gain attributable to intangibles other than goodwill and goodwill up to
the maximum of $350,000,000), then in each Financial Year a cash amount equal to
the product of (x) the amount of any deduction attributable to the basis of such
intangible allocated to RBS pursuant to Clause 11.3 multiplied by (y) the highest of the
marginal U.S., state and local tax rates (calculated by taking into account all applicable
U.S. federal, state and local tax taxes) imposed on RBS due to the activities of the
Partnership for such Financial Year, shall be distributed to SG or SETI (as selected by
Sempra Energy) within one (1) week from completion of the audit of the Accounts in

32

7.9

8.2

such Financial Year. If any member of the Sempra Group is required to recognise gain
under U.S. federal income tax law on a sale to the Partnership (whether deemed or
otherwise) of any intangible attributable to the SET Business in connection with the
transactions undertaken pursuant to the Master Formation and Equity Interest
Purchase Agreement pursuant to a determination by any Governmental Body in a
Financial Year other than the Financial Year of the closing of the transactions
undertaken pursuant to the Master Formation and Equity Interest Purchase Agreement,
then SG or SETI, as appropriate, shall be entitled to a cash distribution equal to the
sum of the amounts that would have been distributed to them in all Financial Years
prior to the Financial Year of such determination pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence (each such amount increased by an appropriate rate of interest) as soon as
reasonably practicable after such determination by such Governmental Body.

Withholding

The Partnership shall deduct and withhold from any amounts distributed to any Member such
amounts required to be deducted and withheld by any applicable Tax law, as reasonably
determined by the tax matters partner. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be treated
for all purposes as having been distributed to the Member from which such amounts were
deducted or withheld by the Partnership, and such amounts shall be delivered by the
Partnership to the applicable Governmental Body. If the Partnership was obligated to withhold
from amounts distributed or allocated to any Member and the partnership did not withhold as
obligated, then such Member shall be obligated to pay to the Partnership the liability imposed
on the Partnership by the relevant Governmental Body due to its failure to withhold such
amounts (including any interest and penalties imposed on amounts determined to be due).

Operating Losses
Attribution of Net Losses

8.1.1 In any Financial Year in which the Accounts do not show Adjusted Global Net Income,
fifty percent (50%) of US Net Losses shall be attributable to SG, and an amount equal
to the amount of such losses shall be deducted from the SG Adjusted Contribution
Amount, which may cause the SG Adjusted Contribution Amount to be negative.

8.1.2. In any Financial Year in which the Accounts do not show Adjusted Global Net Income,
fifty percent (50%) of Non-US Net Losses shall be attributable to SETI, and an amount
equal to the amount of such losses shall be deducted from the SETI Adjusted
Contribution Amount, which may cause the SETI Adjusted Contribution Amount to be
negative.

8.1.3. In any Financial Year in which the Accounts show an Adjusted Global Net Loss, fifty
percent (50%) of the Adjusted Global Net Losses shall be attributable to the RBS
Member Group, and an amount equal to the amount of such losses shall be deducted
from the RBS Adjusted Contribution Amount, which may cause the RBS Adjusted
Contribution Amount to be negative.

Adjustments to Adjusted Contribution Amounts

In any Financial Year in which the Accounts do not show Adjusted Global Net Income, and
there is either US Net Income or Non-US Net Income, then an amount equal to fifty percent

33

9.2

10
10.1

10.2

(50%) of the US Net Income or Non-US Net Income, as appropriate, shall be added to the SG
Adjusted Contribution Amount (where there is US Net Income) or to the SETI Adjusted
Contribution Amount (where there is Non-US Net Income).

Application of Distributions to the Adjusted Contribution Amounts

To the extent that, on the last day of any Financial Year, the Sempra Adjusted Contribution
Amount (after giving effect to any contributions made pursuant to Clause 5.5) is less than the
amount of both the Sempra High Water Mark and the Total FSA Regulatory Capital (the lesser
of such two amounts, the “Sempra Applicable Level”), if the Board so directs in writing no
later than five (5) Business Days following the Allocation Percentage Calculation Date for such
Financial Year, (i) an amount shall be added to the Sempra Adjusted Contribution Amount
equal to the lesser of (a) the S Maximum Entitlement for such Financial Year and (b) the
excess, if any, of the Sempra Applicable Level over the Sempra Adjusted Contribution Amount
(before giving effect to the operation of this Clause 9.1 in such Financial Year) and (ii) an
amount shall be added to the RBS Adjusted Contribution Amount equal to the lesser of (a) the
amount added to the Sempra Adjusted Contribution Amount pursuant to clause (i) and (b) the
RBS Maximum Entitlement for such Financial Year. Where any amount has been added to the
Sempra Adjusted Contribution Amount or the RBS Adjusted Contribution Amount, as the case
may be, pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the amount so added shall be
treated as having been distributed to the applicable Member for the purposes of this
Agreement. Concurrently with the additions described above, RBS shall make a Contribution
to the Partnership in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount credited to the
Sempra Adjusted Contribution Amount pursuant to the second preceding sentence over (ii) the
RBS Maximum Entitlement for such Financial Year.

Any amount added to the Adjusted Contribution Amounts of the Sempra Members pursuant to
Clause 9.1 shall be added to such Adjusted Contribution Amounts in proportion to the
distributions that would otherwise have been received by such Members pursuant to
Clause 7.2.

United Kingdom Tax Matters

For the purposes of United Kingdom corporation tax, any Adjusted Global Net Income shall be
allocated to the Members in accordance with Clause 7 and any Adjusted Global Net Losses
shall be allocated in accordance with Clause 8.

Surrender of Losses

10.2.1 To the extent that losses arising in the Partnership or any subsidiary of the Partnership
cannot be surrendered by way of a claim pursuant to s.402(2) Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988, the Partnership shall, and shall procure that a subsidiary of the
Partnership shall, surrender to RBS (or any other company in the RBS group by or to
which a surrender is permitted by s406 and Part X Chapter IV Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1988) any group relief which may be surrendered by way of a consortium
claim pursuant to s.402(3) Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and which arises
from the activities of the Partnership or any subsidiary for a consideration in
accordance with Clause 10.2.2 below.

10.2.2 The consideration mentioned in Clause 10.2.1 shall be equal to the amount of relief

34

10.3

10.4

11

which is surrendered, multiplied by the then prevailing rate of UK corporation tax which
applies for the accounting period of the entity in which the relief arises (ignoring any
lower rate of corporation tax which is levied on companies with lower levels of taxable
profits), or such other amount as may be agreed between the Members from time to
time. Where there is more than one rate of corporation tax for the accounting period in
question, the rate shall be determined by using the rate applicable to the relevant
portion of the accounting period. Such consideration is payable at the later of the date
the surrender is made or twelve (12) months after the end of the accounting period of
the entity in which the relief arises.

For the purposes of United Kingdom corporation tax, insofar as profits of any member of the
SET Group are taken into account in determining the Adjusted Global Net Income for a
Financial Year and a dividend is paid to the Partnership representing such profits in a
subsequent Financial Year, such dividend shall be shared between the Members by the
application of the Allocation Percentage calculated in respect of the Financial Year in which the
profits were taken into account.

RBS shall be entitled to make an application to treat any member of the SET Group as a
member of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc VAT group. If RBS determines to make
such application, RBS shall indemnify the SET Group and the Sempra Members against any
additional VAT liabilities for which any member of the SET Group or any Sempra Member is
secondarily liable as a consequence of such VAT grouping but which is primarily the liability of
a Person not belonging to the SET Group.

U.S. Tax Matters and Permanent Establishment Tax Matters

To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Sempra Members will decline to serve as, and
RBS will agree to serve as, the “tax matters partner” for purposes of section 6231(a)(7) of the
Code. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, all Members agree to accept RBS as the tax
matters partner. The tax matters partner shall have all of the rights, powers and obligations
provided for in section 6221 through 6231 of the Code with respect to the Partnership. The
Board shall take any steps necessary pursuant to Code Section 6223(a) to designate each
Member as a “notice partner” (as defined in Code Section 6231(a)(8)). In addition, nothing in
this Agreement is intended to waive any rights, including rights to participate in administrative
and judicial proceedings, that a Member may have under Code Sections 6221 through 6233,
inclusive.

The Partnership shall elect to be classified as a partnership for US federal income tax
purposes by filing an election on Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 (or any successor form)
and the Partnership shall also timely make all corresponding elections for US state and US
local tax purposes (collectively, the “Partnership Election”). The Partnership Election shall be
made no later than thirty (30) days after formation of the Partnership and such election shall be
effective as of the date of formation. The Partnership Election may be signed by any Director of
the Partnership who is authorised by the Board to sign on behalf of the Partnership, and each
party to this Agreement who must sign the Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 (or any
successor form) for it to be valid, and each party to this Agreement which has an affiliate that
must sign the Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 (or any successor form) for it to be valid,
shall sign the Internal Revenue Service Form 8832 (or any successor form) or cause it to be
signed within a reasonable amount of time in order for the Partnership to comply with this

35

Clause 11.2. The Partnership shall not revoke or alter this election without the unanimous
consent of its Members.

Capital Accounts; Book Allocations

11.3.1

11.3.2

There shall be established for each Member on the books of the Partnership as of the
date hereof, or such later date on which such Member is admitted to the Partnership, a
capital account (each being a “Capital Account’). The Capital Account of each
Member shall be credited with the amount of any initial capital contribution made by
such Member (as set forth in Clause 5.1), increased by any allocation of US
Partnership Net Income, Non-US Partnership Net Income, any items in the nature of
income or gain which are specifically allocated pursuant to Clause 11.3.2 or 11.3.3 and
by any additional capital contributions by that Member and shall be reduced by any
distribution, allocation of US Partnership Net Loss, Non-US Partnership Net Loss, and
any items in the nature of expenses or losses specifically allocated pursuant to Clause
11.3.2 or 11.3.3 to that Member. Capital Accounts shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect transfers of part (but not all) of a Member’s interest in the Partnership (or shall
be dissolved and terminated in the case of a transfer of all of such Member's interest in
the Partnership). The initial Capital Account balance of each Member shall be as set
forth in Schedule 11.3.1. In all respects, the Members’ Capital Accounts shall be
determined in accordance with the detailed capital account rules set forth in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).

General Allocations

(i) After making the allocations as required in Clause 11.3.3 and subject to
Clause 11.3.2(ii), Partnership Net Income or Partnership Net Loss shall be
allocated to RBS, SG and SETI in a manner such that each of their Capital
Accounts, immediately after making such allocation, is, as nearly as possible,
equal (proportionately) to the distributions that each would receive if the
Partnership were dissolved, its affairs wound up and its assets sold for cash
equal to their fair market value (as determined under U.S. federal income tax
principles) and such cash were actually distributed in accordance with the
priorities of distribution set forth in Clause 16.4.1, minus (A) each Member’s
share of the Partnership’s “partnership minimum gain” as that term is defined in
Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(b)(2) and 1.704-2(d) and (B) the amount,
with respect to the partner nonrecourse debt of a Member (as that term is
defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(b)(4)) equal to the partnership
minimum gain that would result if such nonrecourse debt were treated as a
nonrecourse liability, determined in accordance with Treasury Regulations
section 1.704-2(i)(3).

(ii) In making the allocations provided for in Clause 11.3.2(i), SG shall receive
solely allocations of US Partnership Net Income or US Partnership Net Loss, as
the case may be, and SETI shall receive solely allocations of Non-US
Partnership Net Income or Non-US Partnership Net Loss, as the case may be.
All items making up US Partnership Net Income or US Partnership Net Loss, as
the case may be, shall be allocated between RBS and SG in the same
proportion as Partnership Net Income or Partnership Net Loss, as applicable, is
allocated between RBS, on the one hand, and the Sempra Members, on the

36

(iii)

other hand, pursuant to Clause 11.3.2(i). All items of Non-US Partnership Net
Income or Non-US Partnership Net Loss, as the case may be, shall be
allocated between RBS and SETI in the same proportion as Partnership Net
Income or Partnership Net Loss, as applicable, is allocated between RBS, on
the one hand, and the Sempra Members, on the other hand, pursuant to
Clause 11.3.2(i).

To the extent not otherwise taken into account in this Clause 11.3.2 or
Clause 11.3.3, if any amount is distributed to any Member pursuant to Clause
7.3.4, an amount of US Partnership Net Income (if SG received the
distribution), Non-US Partnership Net Income (if SETI received the distribution),
or Partnership Net Income determined in accordance with Code section 703(a)
(if RBS received the distribution) equal to the amount distributed to such
Member shall be allocated to such Member, and an amount of items of loss or
deduction equal to the amount of the Out of Pocket and Tax Damages paid, set
off against distributions pursuant to Clause 7.3.1 or released from escrow
pursuant to Clause 7.3.3(ii)(b) or (c)(x) shall be allocated to such Member who
is the Indemnifying Person.

11.3.3 Special Allocations

(i)

(iii)

If the Partnership incurs any item of loss or deduction, where the Partnership is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 of the Master Formation and
Equity Interest Purchase Agreement for such loss or deduction, then the item of
loss or deduction shall be allocated to SG (if the item of loss or deduction is
attributable to the US Business) or shall be allocated to SETI (if the item of loss
or deduction is attributable to the Non-US Business).

Any deduction arising from the amortization or impairment of any goodwill, up
to an amount equal to $350,000,000, shall be allocated fifty percent (50%) to
SG and fifty percent (50%) to RBS.

Clause 11 is intended to comply with Section 704(b) of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, including the “alternative test for economic
effect” under Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(ii)(d). Notwithstanding
Clause 11.3.2, the Partnership shall make any allocations required by such
Treasury Regulations, including “qualified income offset” and “minimum gain
chargeback” allocations and allocations relating to any nonrecourse debt of the
Partnership, prior to making the allocations set forth in Clause 11.3.2 or in
Clause 11.3.3(i) or (ii).

In the event any Member has a deficit Capital Account at the end of any Fiscal
Year which is in excess of the sum of (a) the amount such Member is obligated
to restore, if any, pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and (b) the
amount such Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the
penultimate sentences of Treasury Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(1) and
1.704-2(i)(5), each such Member shall be specially allocated items of
Partnership income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as
possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this Clause 11.3.3(iv) shall be
made only if and to the extent that a Member would have a deficit Capital
Account in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in this

37

11.4

Clause 11 have been tentatively made as if the second sentence in
Clause 11.3.3(iii) and this Clause 11.3.3(iv) were not in this Agreement.

For U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, the income, gains, losses and
deductions of the Partnership shall, for each taxable period, be allocated among the Members
in the same manner and in the same proportion that such items have been allocated among
the Members’ respective Capital Accounts; provided, however, that in accordance with Section
704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, (i) income, gain, loss and
deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Partnership shall, solely
for tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take account of any variation
between the adjusted basis of such property to the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax
purposes and its initial Carrying Value, and (ii) in the event the Carrying Value of any
Partnership asset is adjusted as a result of any revaluations as set forth in the definition of the
term “Carrying Value” in this Agreement, subsequent allocations of income, gain, loss and
deduction with respect to such asset shall take into account any variation between the adjusted
basis of such asset for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its Carrying Value, in each case
using any method or methods permitted under Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations thereunder as determined by the Board.

Unless otherwise required (x) as the result of a change in Applicable Law occurring after the
date hereof and with respect to which the Partnership has received an opinion from counsel,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to each of the Members, stating that there is no
reasonable basis for continuing to treat the Partnership in the manner described below (it being
agreed that Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Pricewaterhouse
Coopers LLP are deemed, for this purpose, to be acceptable counsel) or (y) pursuant to a
“determination” pursuant to Section 1313(a) of the Code or other Applicable Law, the parties
hereto agree to treat, for all U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes (including,
without limitation, for purposes of any position taken by any party hereto on any U.S. federal,
state or local income Tax Return), (i) the Partnership as a partnership and (ii) the Partnership
as the owner of the trades arising from the performance of the Trading Activities (as this term is
defined in the Commodities Trading Activities Master Agreement). Unless otherwise required
pursuant to a “determination” pursuant to Section 1313(a) of the Code or other Applicable Law,
the parties hereto agree to act in accordance with this Clause 11.5 in the filing of all U.S.
federal, state or local income Tax Returns and in the course of any U.S. federal, state or local
income Tax audit, U.S. federal, state or local income Tax review or U.S. federal, state or local
income Tax litigation related thereto, and the parties hereto agree to take no position or action
inconsistent with such treatment for any U.S. income Tax purposes. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Clause 11.5 shall survive the dissolution of
the Partnership or the termination of any Member’s interest in the Partnership and shall remain
binding on all Members for a period of time necessary to resolve with the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service or any applicable state or local taxing authority all matters (including
litigation) regarding the U.S. federal, state and local income taxation, as the case may be, of
the Partnership or any Member with respect to the Partnership.

Permanent Establishment

11.6.1 Sempra Energy and the Sempra Members agree with RBS that the Sempra Members
and RBS shall use all reasonable endeavours to take such steps as are necessary to
file any returns or declarations or make any registrations in respect of Taxes as may be
necessary or appropriate, in any jurisdictions in which either the Partnership or any

38

12
12.1

11.6.2

11.6.3

Member is or is treated under any applicable law relating to Tax as carrying on
business, on the basis that either (i) the Partnership is or (ii) both SETI and RBS are
carrying on business in that jurisdiction whether or not through a permanent
establishment.

If RBS or any Sempra Member is charged or subjected to Tax in any Financial Year in
respect of its permanent establishment in the relevant jurisdiction on an amount of
Adjusted Global Net Income which is greater than the amount of Adjusted Global Net
Income it would have been charged or subjected to Tax on if the Partnership had been
treated as having a permanent establishment in the relevant jurisdiction, the parties will
work together jointly to minimize such Tax and also take all reasonable steps to ensure
that each party, SG, SETI and RBS, will be charged or subjected to Tax, through direct
reimbursement payments among the Members, equal to the amount that would be
incurred if they received their Allocation Percentages of income in respect of such
jurisdiction and will, if necessary, share in any additional Tax imposed upon them as a
group in excess of such amounts on a proportionate basis using the Allocation
Percentages for that Financial Year.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Clause 11.6, the Members shall reasonably
cooperate and take commercially reasonable steps so as to minimize situations where
either RBS or an Sempra Member is charged or subjected to Tax in respect of its
permanent establishment in a jurisdiction on an amount of Adjusted Global Net Income
which is greater than the amount of Adjusted Global Net Income calculated as
attributable to such Member in accordance with the Allocation Percentage for the
relevant Financial Year.

Board, Member Meetings and Reserved Matters

Board Constitution and Meetings

12.1.1

12.1.2

12.1.3

On or prior to the date hereof, RBS shall have delivered a written notice to the other
Members naming four (4) individuals as the initial RBS Directors and the Sempra
Member Group shall have delivered a written notice to the other Members naming
three (3) individuals as the initial Sempra Directors.

The number of Directors shall at all times be seven (7) unless otherwise agreed
between RBS and the Sempra Members. RBS may by written notice to the Board
appoint up to four (4) Directors and the Sempra Members may by written notice to the
Board appoint up to three (3) Directors. If, at any time, the Members determine, with
the consent of at least one Sempra Member, to add a representative of the SET
Group’s management to the Board as a Director, the number of Directors shall be
increased by two (2), including such representative of the SET Group’s management
and such additional Director as RBS may by written notice to the Board appoint, and
the number of Directors that the Sempra Members are entitled to appoint shall not be
affected. The Directors may, by notice to the Board in writing, appoint a proxy (whether
or not a Director) to attend and vote at meetings of the Board on their behalf.

The Board can, by majority vote and on ten (10) days prior written notice to the party
that appointed the relevant Director, resolve to remove an RBS Director or an Sempra
Director from the Board for Cause; provided that such removal shall not prejudice the

39

12.1.4

12.1.5

12.1.6

12.1.7

right of such Director’s appointor(s) to appoint a replacement Director (who may not be
the same person as the removed Director).

Without prejudice to reimbursement of expenses and unless otherwise agreed by the
Board, the Directors shall not have any rights to remuneration by the Partnership.

The Board shall meet as and when required, but no less than once every three months.
Any Director may convene a meeting of the Board upon the provision of reasonable
written notice to the other Directors.

The quorum for Board meetings shall be not less than three Directors, comprising at
least two RBS Directors and one Sempra Director, present in person or by audio or by
video conferencing. The chairman of any Board meeting shall be determined by the
Directors appointed by RBS amongst themselves at the commencement of each such
meeting. If a quorum is not present within an hour of the time appointed for the meeting
or ceases to be present, the Director(s) present shall adjourn the meeting to the same
location at a time being 48 hours from the point at which the original scheduled
meeting was not quorate. Notice of the first adjourned meeting shall be given, to the
extent practicable, by the Board to each of the Directors. The quorum at any such
adjourned meeting shall be at least three RBS Directors.

At every Board meeting, every Director present shall have one vote. All decisions of the
Board shall, unless otherwise specified, be determined by a majority of the Directors
present from time to time voting in favour; provided always that none of the Reserved
Matters may be determined by the Board without the consent of at least one of the
Sempra Directors. No member of the Board shall be entitled to a second or casting
vote. A resolution in writing circulated to all Directors and subsequently signed as
approved by all of the Directors unanimously from time to time shall be as valid and
effective as a resolution passed at such a meeting. All or any of the members of the
Board may participate in a meeting of the Board by means of any communication
equipment which allows all persons participating in the meeting to hear each other and
to address all of the other participants simultaneously. A person so participating shall be
deemed to be present in person at the meeting and shall be entitled to be counted
towards the quorum and to vote. Such a meeting shall be deemed to take place where
the largest group of those participating is assembled or, if there is no such group,
where the chairman of the meeting is present.

12.2 Management of the SET Group

12.2.1

12.2.2

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement and any applicable legislation, including the
Act, the Board shall have exclusive responsibility for the management and control of
the Business and the affairs of the Partnership on behalf of the Members and shall
have the power and authority to delegate any of its powers to one or more committees
of the Board (each of which shall include at least one Sempra Director, and at least one
Sempra Director for every two RBS Directors on such committee) and to do all things
necessary to carry out the purpose of the Partnership and shall carry on and manage
the same with the assistance from time to time of the Members and of agents, servants
or other employees of the Partnership as it shall deem necessary.

Subject to Clause 12.2.6, the Board shall have full power and authority on behalf of
and at the cost of the Partnership and with the power to bind the Partnership thereby to

40

12.2.3

12.2.4

12.2.5

12.2.6

deal with and/or to engage on behalf of the Partnership such Person (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any Person associated with a Member) as the Board shall deem
desirable to deal with all Tax affairs of the Partnership including, without limitation, the
preparation and submission of any Tax Returns required to be submitted by the
Partnership and the preparation of all documentation and the handling of all matters
(including correspondence) and disputes relating to such Tax affairs with any relevant
Tax authority; provided that the Board shall be obliged (i) to provide each Member with
copies of any correspondence or documents relevant to that Member received by the
Partnership from any Tax authority or similar agency promptly upon receipt and (ii) to
provide the Members with notice of all scheduled administrative proceedings or audits,
including meetings with agents or representatives of any Tax authorities, technical
advice conferences and appellate hearings as soon as possible after receiving notice
of the scheduling of proceedings; provided, however, that nothing in this Clause shall
entitle a Member to receive information or documents that relate solely to the Tax
position of other Members. Each Member shall provide all assistance as is necessary
to enable the Board and any Person engaged by the Board to deal with and manage
the Tax affairs of the Partnership in accordance with this Clause.

Following the end of each Financial Year, the Board shall use reasonable endeavours
to cause the Partnership to prepare and send, or cause to be prepared and sent, within
ninety (90) days of the completion of the audit for such Financial Year by the Auditors,
to each Person who was a Member at any time during such Financial Year, copies of
such information as may be required for applicable Tax reporting purposes, including,
without limitation, such information as a Member may reasonably request for the
purpose of applying for refunds of withholding taxes.

The day-to-day management of the SET Group shall be conducted by management
appointed by the Board for such purpose and shall comply with Board directives and
applicable RBS Policies and shall at all times be governed and operated in a manner
consistent with this Agreement and the government and operation of other members of
the RBS integrated group. RBS shall provide the Directors with copies of, or
reasonable access to, the RBS Policies and any revisions thereto.

The following matters shall be reserved to the Board:
(i) the declaration and payment of distributions; and
(ii) each of the Reserved Matters.

With respect to any income or direct Tax Return of the Partnership or any other
member of the SET Group, the preparation of which is controlled by the Partnership
pursuant to Section 10.3(c) of the Master Formation and Equity Interest Purchase
Agreement, which relates in any way to the portion of any Straddle Period for the
Partnership or any other member of the SET Group which ends on the date of the
Closing, the Board shall circulate to the Sempra Member Group for their review and
approval a draft of such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days before such Tax Return is
to be filed, and the Sempra Member Group shall provide any comments on such Tax
Return to the Board at least fifteen (15) days before such Tax Return is to be filed. The
Board shall not file any such Tax Return without the approval of the Sempra Member
Group, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If either Sempra
Member objects to any items on the Tax Return which affect the Taxes of the

Partnership or any other member of the SET Group relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or to the portion of any Straddle Period for the Partnership or any other member
of the SET Group which ends on the date of the Closing, then the Board must adopt
the position of such Sempra Member unless such position may cause a material
adverse Tax consequence to the Partnership or RBS. If such position may cause a
material adverse Tax consequence to the Partnership or RBS but an opinion of suitable
independent tax counsel, concluding that such Sempra Member’s position is more
likely to succeed than not, is obtained in the relevant jurisdiction at Sempra Energy’s
expense, then the position of such Sempra Member must be adopted by the Board.

Unless otherwise required (x) as the result of a change in Applicable Law occurring
after the date hereof and with respect to which the Partnership has received an opinion
from counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to each of the Members,
stating that there is no reasonable basis for continuing to report receipts in the manner
described below (it being agreed that Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are deemed, for this purpose, to be
acceptable counsel) or (y) pursuant to a “determination” pursuant to Section 1313(a) of
the Code or other Applicable Law, the Partnership shall report receipts from physical
commodities trading activities on a gross basis in preparing all U.S. federal, state and
local income Tax Returns (including but not limited to U.S. Internal Revenue Form
1065, California income tax form 565, and any Schedules K-1 issued by the
Partnership to any Member).

12.3.3

12.3.4

Without prejudice to Clause 12.2.1 above, if the Board resolves that any decision of the
Partnership should be taken at a general meeting of the Members, then it shall have
the power to call such meeting at no less than seven (7) clear days’ notice.

All Members shall be entitled to attend any general meeting of Members, but only RBS
and the Sempra Members (or their permitted assignees from time to time) shall be
entitled to vote. Decisions shall be made by them on a show of hands by a simple
majority and, other than in relation to Reserved Matters, RBS (or its permitted
assignee) shall have one more vote than the Sempra Members. No resolution
concerning a Reserved Matter shall be approved without the consent of at least one of
the Sempra Members.

The chairman and the secretary of any Member meeting shall be determined by the
Board at the time such meeting is called (if called by the Board). The secretary shall
record the number of votes cast in favour of or against each resolution, and such
record, along with a declaration by the chairman certifying the accuracy of such record,
shall be conclusive evidence of the adoption of such resolution.

Any consent required of a Member under this Agreement, other than any consent
under Clause 12.3.2, may be given by such Member in writing, without a meeting of the
Members.

Reserved Matters

12.4.1

cease to operate or materially reduce the scope of the business carried on as

performance;

incur any Indebtedness other than (a) Indebtedness that is incurred in order to

by RBS and its Associated Companies, (y) is required under Applicable Law to

prior to the Partnership incurring such Indebtedness, RBS has agreed with the
Partnership or the third party from which such Indebtedness is incurred that
RBS will pay the interest accruing in respect of such Indebtedness to the extent
exceeding LIBOR plus fifty (50) basis points and, in the case of this clause (z),

43

the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of the Partnership owing to Persons

furtherance of the above specified Reserved Matters, or otherwise attempt to
take any action in furtherance of the above specified Reserved Matters, either
directly or indirectly.

If the Partnership or RBS is compelled to take any action or engage in activity that
constitutes a Reserved Matter in order to comply with Applicable Laws, and the
consent of at least one of the Sempra Members has not been obtained, then, before
taking any such action or engaging in any such activity, RBS or the Partnership shall

44

provide the Sempra Members with notice as soon as is reasonably practicable of its
intent to take such action or engage in such conduct (which notice shall, if reasonably
practicable, be in writing). If, upon receipt of such notice, at least one Sempra Member
does not consent to the taking of such action or the engaging in such conduct, then the
Partnership or RBS, as applicable, shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult
in good faith with the Sempra Members in order to determine whether compliance with
such Applicable Law can be achieved by curing any fact or circumstance that is then
existing, or taking any other course of action, rather than by taking action or engaging
in any activity that constitutes a Reserved Matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither RBS nor the Partnership shall be deemed to be in breach of this Clause 12.4 if,
as a result of Applicable Law, RBS or the Partnership, as the case may be, is unable to
either provide the notice or engage in the consultation required above because the
time delay required to provide such notice or engage in such consultation would pose
an immediate and significant risk to RBS or the Partnership, respectively. The
Partnership or RBS, as applicable, shall provide written notice to the Sempra Members
of any action taken pursuant to the preceding sentence concurrently with or
immediately following the taking of any such action.

12.5 Notice Matters

12.5.1

The Partnership shall not, and shall not permit any subsidiary of the Partnership to, do
any of the following without first providing notice and a reasonable opportunity to
consult to the Sempra Member Group (provided that such requirement shall be
deemed satisfied with respect to any matter that has been presented to the Board):

(i) sell, transfer, assign, hypothecate, encumber, license or sublicense any of the
Partnership’s or any of its subsidiary’s trading models, licenses, copyrights,
works that are the subject matter of copyrights, trademarks, tradenames, trade
styles, trademark applications or any rights under any of the foregoing; any
extensions, renewals, reissues, or configurations of the same; any trade
secrets, formulae, processes, or any trade secrets or contract rights relating to
computer hardware or software programs;

(ii) except as has been provided for in a capital budget approved by the
Partnership and previously distributed to the Sempra Member Group, make or
commit to make capital expenditures in excess of (x) $5,000,000 with respect
to any individual expenditure or (y) $10,000,000 in the aggregate during any
Financial Year;

(iii) enter into, materially amend or terminate any agreement with respect to a
Commodity Transaction that (a) has a term longer than five (5) years and

Partnership or any subsidiary of the Partnership in excess of $1,000,000,000 or
(b) provides for aggregate payments, based on then-current prices, by or to the
Partnership or any subsidiary of the Partnership in excess of $5,000,000,000.
For purposes of this clause (iii), “then-current prices” means current prices
determined at the time the parties thereto enter into such agreement and in the
case of (1)a physical Commodity Transaction that provides for a fixed
purchase or sales price, the Dollar present value of such price; (2) a physical
Commodity Transaction that provides for an index purchase or sales price, the

45

Dollar present value of the forward prices for such index during the term of
such transaction that are utilized by the relevant SET Group member to
determine the mark-to-market valuation for such transaction; and (3)a
Commodity Transaction that is a derivative, the net settlement amount for each
settlement date during the term of such transaction, based on the Dollar
present value of the applicable forward prices during the term of such
transaction that are utilized by the relevant SET Group member to determine
the mark-to-market valuation for such transaction;

(iv) compromise or settle any litigation or claim involving an amount in excess of
$10,000,000 or any governmental audit or investigation involving an amount in
excess of $1,000,000;

(v) hire, discharge or materially alter the total annual compensation of any
employee who (a) was, in the most recently completed Financial Year, entitled
to (x) a twenty-five percent (25%) or greater share of the Net Trading Revenue
(or other revenue, income or margin metric) generated by such employee
(directly or through the results of a group of employees) or (y) guaranteed total
annual compensation in excess of $2,000,000 or (b) is a Senior Managing
Director or an employee equivalent in stature to an employee holding such title
or who, within the preceding twelve (12) months, had been employed at or
above the level of Senior Managing Director or an equivalent stature; provided
that, with regard to the hiring of an employee, the altering of an employee’s
compensation or the discharge of an employee for cause, the Partnership shall
not be obligated, under this Clause 12.5.1, to provide the Sempra Member
Group with an opportunity to consult prior to taking such action but shall remain
obligated to provide the required notice; or

(vi) cease to operate or materially reduce the scope of, as a result of any adverse
change in market conditions or historical performance, the business carried on
as at the date hereof by the four (4) principal business units of the SET Group,
being Gas, Power, Oil and Metals; provided that the Partnership and its
subsidiaries shall only be required to provide notice and a reasonable
opportunity to consult under this clause (vi) if it is reasonably practicable to do
so.

12.5.2. RBS shall provide notice promptly and in no event less than one (1) Business Day
following: (i) the resignation of the Auditors (or receipt by RBS or any RBS Director of
an indication that the Auditors decline to be considered for re-appointment after
completion of the current audit), (ii) the dismissal of the Auditor, (iii) the appointment of
a new Auditor, and (iv) any disagreement between RBS or the Board, on the one hand,
and the Auditors, on the other hand, regarding accounting or auditing matters or (v) the
occurrence of any other event that would constitute a reportable event under US
Securities and Exchange Commission Form 8-K if the Partnership were required to file
such reports.

12.6 Duties of the RBS Directors and the Sempra Directors

In taking any action, making any decision or exercising any discretion with respect to the
Partnership:

46

12.7

13
13.1

12.6.1. each RBS Director and each Sempra Director shall be entitled to consider such
interests and factors as such Director deems appropriate, including the interests of the
Member(s) entitled to appoint such Director;

12.6.2. no RBS Director nor Sempra Director shall have any duty or obligation to give any
consideration to the interests of, or factors affecting, the Partnership, the Members
other than the Member(s) entitled to appoint such Director; and

12.6.3 no RBS Director or Sempra Director shall have any duty or obligation, except as
explicitly required herein, to abstain from participating in any vote or other action of the
Partnership or any of its subsidiaries.

No RBS Director or Sempra Director shall have breached any duty or obligation to the
Partnership or the Members solely as a result of any of the foregoing.

Rights Following Certain Transfers

In the event that either SG or SETI, but not both, has Transferred its interest in the Partnership
pursuant to Clause 16.3.2 to a Person other than RBS or an Associated Company of RBS,
then the references to “Sempra Members”, “Sempra Member Group” and “Sempra Director” in
this Clause 12, and the rights of the Sempra Members to appoint such directors and otherwise
to exercise rights under this Clause 12, shall reside with the Member or Members that continue
to be part of the Sempra Member Group. The Successor Member of the last Sempra Member
to sell its interest in the Partnership shall succeed to all such rights.

Funding of Ongoing Operations, Cost of Funds and Agreements with Affiliates
Funding of Ongoing Operations

13.1.1 RBS covenants and agrees with the Partnership and the Sempra Members that it shall
lend cash and other working capital to the SET Group as necessary to fund all of the
SET Group’s ongoing operating expenses, including in all events sufficient funds to pay
all of the SET Group’s obligations to its employees. In addition, RBS hereby affirms its
intention to provide capital to the Partnership (i) to support the trading activities of the
SET Group (including transactions entered into on RBS’s books under the
Commodities Trading Activities Master Agreement) at a minimum as reasonably
necessary to support the SET Group’s trading activities at the level prevailing as of the
date of the Closing, (ii) to fund the then-current business plan of the Partnership and
(iii) as required to support available Partnership business opportunities, in each case
with the objective of supporting the reasonable growth of the SET Business (and, in
each case, taking into consideration adverse changes in market conditions, historical
performance and future prospects of the SET Business).

13.1.2. If RBS has materially failed to provide capital to the Partnership for any material period
in accordance with the covenants or intentions set forth in Clause 13.1.1, then the
Sempra Member Group may notify RBS, and RBS shall have ten (10) Business Days
to cure such failure or reach agreement with the Sempra Member Group regarding
such failure.

13.1.3 If (x) RBS has failed to provide capital to the Partnership for any material period in
accordance with the covenants or intentions set forth in Clause 13.1.1 and has
received notice thereof pursuant to Section 13.1.2 and RBS does not cure such failure

47

or RBS and the Sempra Member Group are unable to reach agreement within the
period specified in Clause 13.1.2 or (y) except in connection with a cessation or
reduction of the scope of the business carried on as of the date hereof by the four (4)
principal business units of the SET Group to the extent undertaken pursuant to
Clause 12.4.1(vi) or to which the Sempra Member Group consented, RBS has
suspended a material portion of the authority of the SET Group or its representatives
under the Commodities Trading Activities Master Agreement (whether by suspension
pursuant to Section 7.2 thereof or by any action or series of actions having a similar
effect) for a period of time that has a material and adverse effect on the Business, then
the Sempra Member Group shall have the following remedy (which shall be the
Sempra Member Group’s sole right with respect to such failure or suspension):

(i) The Sempra Member Group shall have the option, in its sole discretion, to
deliver to RBS a “Purchase Notice” within ninety (90) days of the Sempra
Member Group’s notification to RBS under Clause 13.1.2.

(ii) Upon delivery of such Purchase Notice, the Sempra Member Group shall be
obligated to purchase, and the RBS Member Group shall be obligated to sell,
the RBS Member Group’s entire ownership interest in the Partnership for a
cash price equal to (a) the consolidated membership equity of the Partnership
(including any goodwill on the books of the Partnership) p/us, without
duplication, the net book value of any trading positions remaining on the books
of RBS relating to the SET Business, in each case, on the closing date of the
purchase and after giving effect to the termination of all contracts between RBS
and the Partnership and the transfer of trading positions on the books of RBS
pertaining to the SET Business, as provided in Clause 13.1.3(iv), minus (b) the
sum of (x) the Sempra Adjusted Contribution Amount immediately prior to such
purchase plus (y) to the extent included in the consolidated membership equity
of the Partnership, any distributions payable to any Sempra Member pursuant
to Clause 7.2 that have not been distributed by the Partnership to such Sempra
Member (excluding distributions that have been withheld or retained pursuant
to Clause 7.3 or 9.1) plus (c) to the extent not included in the consolidated
membership equity of the Partnership, any distributions payable to the RBS
Member Group pursuant to Clause 7.2 that have not been distributed by the
Partnership to RBS (excluding distributions that have been withheld or retained
pursuant to Clause 7.3 or 9.1) (collectively, the “Buyback Consideration’).
The closing date of such purchase shall occur on the last day of a month, and
unless otherwise stated, each amount in the preceding sentence shall be
determined as of such day as though such day were the end of the Financial
Year (for purposes, among others, of calculating the Allocation Percentages).
The RBS Member Group will prepare an estimated consolidated and combined
balance sheet of the Partnership as of the closing date of such purchase and a
statement setting forth the estimated Buyback Consideration (the “Estimated
Buyback Consideration”) and deliver such balance sheet and such statement
to the Sempra Members five (5) days prior to the closing date of such
purchase. Any financial statements or calculations made pursuant to this
Clause 13.1.3 shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS in a manner
consistent with that used to prepare the Accounts.

Subject to the provisions of the next sentences, the Buyback Consideration

48

(iii)

shall not, in any event, exceed $5,000,000,000. The provisions of the foregoing
sentence are for the benefit of the RBS Member Group alone and may, within
thirty (30) days of receipt of a Purchase Notice, be waived by RBS at its sole
discretion (whether entirely or subject to a higher cap determined by RBS). To
the extent that, at the time of such waiver, RBS or any of its holding companies
remains subject to laws or regulations requiring transactions above a certain
size to be approved by RBS’s, or such holding company’s, as the case may be,
shareholders before such transactions are implemented, such waiver shall only
be effective to the extent that either: (x) the waiver does not result in such a
requirement being triggered or (y) the waiver does trigger such a requirement
but the relevant shareholder approval is obtained within sixty (60) days of the
waiver (and the receipt of such approval or, in its absence, the expiry of such
sixty (60) day period shall be a condition to the completion of such purchase).
If RBS does not waive such limit on the Buyback Consideration or is unable to
obtain shareholder approval for such waiver (or RBS waives such limit subject
to a higher cap) and the calculation of the Buyback Consideration in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Clause 13.1.3(ii) produces a
figure which is in excess of $5,000,000,000 (or such higher cap, as applicable),
the RBS Member Group shall nonetheless be obligated to sell the RBS
Member Group's entire interest in the Partnership to the Sempra Member
Group for a cash price equal to $5,000,000,000 (or such higher cap, as
applicable).

Such purchase shall be subject to the following conditions to closing: (a) the
RBS Member Group shall represent and warrant that it has unencumbered title
to its interests in the Partnership, (b) all necessary regulatory approvals for
such purchase shall have been obtained, (c) the closing date of such purchase
shall occur not later than 120 days following the date of the Purchase Notice
(unless a longer period is required (x) for the Sempra Member Group to obtain
necessary financing to consummate the purchase, arrange for the transfer of
trading positions on the books of RBS relating to the SET Business or arrange
for credit support in favour of RBS with respect to any trading position that
cannot be transferred or liquidated, (y)to obtain necessary regulatory
approvals or (z) as a result of any failure by RBS to cooperate in good faith to
complete such purchase, which longer period shall not, in the case of
clauses (x) and (y) only, exceed 210 days following the date of the Purchase
Notice) and (d) all actions and conditions required by Clause 13.1.3(iv) to have
been taken or satisfied no later than the closing date of such purchase shall
have been satisfied.

Following the receipt of a Purchase Notice and prior to the closing of the
purchase, the Sempra Member Group and RBS Member Group shall take such
actions as are necessary to, no later than the closing date of such purchase,
(x) terminate the Commodities Trading Activities Master Agreement and any
contracts between the SET Group and RBS or its affiliates and Associated
Companies, (y) arrange for the repayment or refinancing of all outstanding
loans between RBS, or any of its Associated Companies, and any member of
the SET Group and (z) with respect to all trading positions and Trading
Agreements relating to the SET Business, including those that are recorded on

49

the books of RBS:

(a)

First, provide for the assignment to or assumption by the SET Group of
such trading positions and Trading Agreements and provide for the
release of any guarantees or credit support provided by RBS or its
Associated Companies with respect to such trading positions and
Trading Agreements;

Second, to the extent the assignment or assumption and release
described in clause (a) is not reasonably practicable, cooperate to
(i) enter into one or more mirror trades, total return swaps or other similar
agreements between RBS, or any applicable Associated Company
thereof, and the applicable members of the SET Group (whose
obligations under such mirror trades, total return swaps or other
agreements shall be supported by the credit of Sempra Energy), in a
form reasonably acceptable to RBS and Sempra Energy, to (A) provide
that all the economics of any such remaining trading positions and
Trading Agreements are transferred to the SET Group and (B) pay a rate
of return to RBS of LIBOR plus fifty (50) basis points (calculated in
accordance with Clause 13.2) on the mark-to-market value of such
trading positions and Trading Agreements and (ii) cause Sempra Energy
and the Sempra Member Group to provide and maintain appropriate third
party credit support in favour of RBS or any applicable Associated
Company thereof, in a form reasonably acceptable to RBS and Sempra
Energy, from a counterparty with a credit rating from a Ratings Agency at
least equal to the then-current rating of the long-term unsecured
unsubordinated debt of RBS with respect to the obligations of
counterparties under such trading positions and Trading Agreements;
provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, RBS may, at its election, cause
the SET Group to liquidate any trading positions or Trading Agreements
in the manner provided in clause (c) below at any time prior to the
establishment of the arrangements described in this clause (b); and

Third, to the extent the assignment or assumption and release described
in clause (a) is not reasonably practicable and the credit support
described in clause (b) cannot reasonably be provided, liquidate any
such trading positions and Trading Agreements; provided that any
aggregate net loss resulting from such liquidations shall be allocated
equally between the Sempra Member Group and the RBS Member
Group and any aggregate net gain resulting from liquidations shall be
allocated to the Members in accordance with Clause 7.1 as though such
gain were Adjusted Global Net Income, and the Buyback Consideration
shall be adjusted accordingly.

If the Sempra Member Group provides third party credit support in respect of
any trading positions or Trading Agreements pursuant to clause (b) above, the
Sempra Member Group shall use commercially reasonable efforts to procure,
as soon as is practicable following the closing of such purchase, and in any
event, shall procure within one (1) year following the closing date of such
purchase, that the obligations of RBS, or its Associated Companies, as the

50

(vii)

(viii)

case may be, with respect to such trading positions or Trading Agreements are
assumed by the SET Group and that RBS, or its Associated Companies, as the
case may be, are released therefrom, or that such trading positions or Trading
Agreements are liquidated. If, at any time after the closing of such purchase,
trading positions or Trading Agreements remain outstanding and RBS notifies
Sempra Energy that there have been material changes in RBS’s credit
exposure to Sempra Energy (as a result of changes in the amount of the
exposure or the credit rating of Sempra Energy) under the mirror trades, swaps
and other agreements described in clause (iv)(b)(i) above, Sempra Energy and
RBS shall cooperate to enter into arrangements to reduce such exposure to the
level existing at the closing of such purchase and shall discuss how the cost of
managing such exposure will be divided among them.

Following the receipt of a Purchase Notice and prior to the closing of the
purchase, the RBS Member Group and the Sempra Member Group shall
cooperate to arrange such transitional arrangements as may be reasonably
available to effect an orderly transition of the Business and to further the
purpose of this Clause 13.1.3.

On the closing date of such purchase, the Sempra Member Group shall pay to
RBS the Estimated Buyback Consideration, and RBS shall sell, assign, transfer
and deliver to the Sempra Member Group all of RBS’s interest in the
Partnership.

As promptly as practicable after the closing date of such purchase, but no later
than ninety (90) days thereafter, the Sempra Member Group shall prepare and
deliver (with assistance as requested from the Partnership and the RBS
Member Group) to RBS, a statement setting forth the proposed Buyback
Consideration (the “Proposed Buyback Consideration”), which shall be
prepared as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on the closing date of such
purchase.

RBS will have twenty (20) Business Days following delivery of the statement
setting forth the Proposed Buyback Consideration during which to notify the
Partnership and the Sempra Member Group in writing (the “Notice of
Objection”) of any objections to the preparation of the statement setting forth
the Proposed Buyback Consideration or the calculation thereof, setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis of its objections and, if practical, the U.S. dollar
amount of each objection. In reviewing the statement of Proposed Buyback
Consideration, RBS shall be entitled to reasonable access to all relevant books,
records and personnel of the Partnership and its representatives to the extent
RBS reasonably requests such information and reasonable access to complete
its review of the Proposed Buyback Consideration. If RBS fails to deliver a
Notice of Objection in accordance with this Clause 13.1.3(viii), the Proposed
Buyback Consideration, together with the Sempra Member Group’s calculation
thereof, shall be conclusive and binding on all parties and it shall become the
“Final Buyback Consideration”. If RBS submits a Notice of Objection, then
(a) for twenty (20) Business Days after the date the Sempra Member Group
receives the Notice of Objection, the Sempra Member Group and RBS will use
their commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the calculation of the Final

51

Buyback Consideration and (b) failing such agreement within twenty (20)
Business Days of such Notice of Objection, the matter will be resolved in
accordance with Clause 13.1.3(ix) below.

(ix) If RBS and the Sempra Member Group have not agreed on the Final Buyback
Consideration within twenty (20) Business Days after delivery of a Notice of
Objection, then the Sempra Member Group and RBS shall each have the right
to deliver notice to the other party (the “Accounting Dispute Notice’) of its
intent to refer the matter for resolution to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or
such other internationally recognised accounting firm as the Members may
agree in writing) (the “Accounting Expert”). Within ten (10) Business Days of
the delivery of the Accounting Dispute Notice (or, if later, the date on which the
Members select an Accounting Expert other than that named above), RBS and
the Sempra Member Group will each deliver to the other and to the Accounting
Expert a notice setting forth in reasonable detail their calculation of the Final
Buyback Consideration. The Members shall procure that, within fifteen (15)
Business Days after receipt thereof, the Accounting Expert will determine its
best estimate of the calculation of the Final Buyback Consideration and provide
a written description of the basis for such determination; provided that, if the
Accounting Expert requests a hearing before making a determination, such
hearing shall be held within twenty (20) Business Days of the parties’ delivery
of their respective calculation notices and the determination of the Final
Buyback Consideration shall be made within ten (10) Business Days of such
hearing. The fees and expenses of the Accounting Expert shall be paid pro
rata by RBS and the Sempra Member Group in accordance with the
percentage of the disputed amounts awarded to the other party (or its
subsidiaries, which for these purposes shall include the Partnership and its
subsidiaries as a subsidiary of the Sempra Member Group) as a result of the
Accounting Expert's decision. Each Party will bear the costs of its own counsel,
witnesses (if any) and employees.

(x) If the Final Buyback Consideration exceeds the Estimated Buyback
Consideration, the Sempra Member Group shall pay (within two (2) Business
Days of determination of the Final Buyback Consideration) an amount equal to
such excess by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the RBS
Member Group to an account specified by the RBS Member Group. If the Final
Buyback Consideration is less than the Estimated Buyback Consideration, the
RBS Member Group shall pay, within two (2) Business Days of determination of
the Final Buyback Consideration, an amount equal to such deficit to the
Sempra Member Group by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an
account specified by the Sempra Member Group.

13.1.4 RBS shall, and shall cause the SET Group to, use reasonable endeavours to make the
most efficient use of the capital maintained in respect of the Business for the purposes
of satisfying the requirements of the FSA and to minimize the Total FSA Regulatory
Capital (to the extent possible without restricting the growth of the Business).

13.2 Cost of Funds
13.2.1. Any funding provided by RBS in respect of the SET Business (including funding

52

13.3

provided for activities conducted on the balance sheet of RBS as principal in respect of
the SET Business) in excess of the Total FSA Regulatory Capital Attributed to the RBS
Member Group (whether or not such amount has been reflected in the RBS Adjusted
Contribution Amount) shall have a rate of return or bear interest at, as the case may
be, a rate not to exceed LIBOR plus fifty (50) basis points. To the extent any such
interest or return payable by the Partnership pursuant to this Clause 13.2.1 is paid to
RBS pursuant to the Commodities Trading Activities Master Agreement or offset
against fees otherwise payable to the Partnership thereunder, the Partnership shall not
be obligated to make any other provision for the payment of such amounts.

13.2.2. Any amount loaned to or deposited with RBS or any of its Associated Companies by
any member of the SET Group shall bear interest (i) to the extent such amount,
together with all other amounts loaned to or deposited with RBS or any of its
Associated Companies by any member of the SET Group, does not exceed the
aggregate amount of funds loaned to, or provided for the benefit of, members of the
SET Group by RBS and its Associated Companies, at a rate not to exceed LIBOR plus
fifty (50) basis points and (ii) to the extent that such amount, together with all other
amounts loaned to or deposited with RBS or any of its Associated Companies by any
member of the SET Group, exceeds the aggregate amount of funds loaned to
members of the SET Group by RBS and its Associated Companies, at a commercially
reasonable rate.

13.2.3. The maturity of LIBOR for purposes of this Agreement shall be determined as follows:

(i) RBS shall use reasonable endeavours to manage the liquidity of the SET
Group in accordance with the RBS Group Liquidity Policy and in compliance
with the regulatory requirements of the FSA. In connection with such liquidity
management, RBS shall determine, in its commercially reasonable judgement,
the maturity with respect to which the relevant LIBOR shall be calculated for
purposes of this Agreement. The Members intend that RBS should not, in the
ordinary course, realize a net profit from borrowings and deposits in respect of
the Business or the SET Business as a result of RBS’s ability to determine the
LIBOR maturity hereunder.

(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), the maturity of LIBOR for purposes of clause (ii)(b)
of the definition of Sempra Member Group’s Preferred Return shall be
overnight.

Agreements with Affiliates

No Member shall, nor shall it permit any of its respective affiliates or Associated Companies to,
provide or agree to provide any goods or services to or for the benefit of any member of the
SET Group, unless (i) the price to be paid by such member of the SET Group in respect of
such goods or services does not exceed the cost to such Member or Associated Company of
providing such goods or services, calculated on the basis set out in Schedule 13.3 and (ii) the
other terms applicable thereto are generally no less favourable to such member of the SET
Group than the terms on which such Member provides similar goods or services to its other
similarly situated Associated Companies. Clause (i) shall not apply to any Market Price
Arrangements, and neither clause (i) nor clause (ii) shall apply to the Commodities Trading
Activities Master Agreement, any transactions contemplated by or entered into under the
Commodities Trading Activities Master Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement or any

53

14
14.1

transaction that the Board, with the consent of at least one of the Sempra Directors, has
exempted from this provision. If any Governmental Body determines that the provision of any
good or service by any Member (or any affiliate or Associated Company thereof) in any
particular jurisdiction at the price required by clause (i) does not comply with applicable transfer
pricing and similar rules, such Member (or affiliate or Associated Company thereof) shall be
permitted to provide such good or service in such jurisdiction at such greater or lesser price as
will cause it to be in compliance with such rules, but such excess or shortfall shall be added to
or subtracted from, as applicable, the Aggregate Transfer Pricing Adjustment for the relevant
period.

Indemnification
Indemnity for Directors

14.1.1. Subject to the provisions of this Clause 14, the Partnership agrees to indemnify each of
the Directors out of its own funds (or out of the proceeds of any insurance policy
maintained by the Partnership in respect of such liabilities) against any expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgements, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such Director on or after the date of this
Agreement as a result of such Director being made or threatened to be made a party to
any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceedings, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that such person is or
was a Director or is or was serving at the request of the Partnership as a director of
another member of the SET Group.

14.1.2 Subject to the provisions of this Clause 14, the Partnership further agrees to indemnify
each of the Directors in respect of out of pocket expenses reasonably incurred by such
Director:

(i) in the ordinary and proper discharge of such Director’s duties in relation to the
conduct of the business of the Partnership; and

(ii) in or about anything necessarily done for the preservation of the business or
property of the Partnership.

14.1.3. This indemnity shall only extend to such costs and expenses incurred by the Director in
relation to the matters in respect of which he is entitled to be indemnified in this
Clause 14.1.

14.2 Limitations on indemnity for Directors

14.2.1 Without prejudice to any other rights or remedies which may be available to the
Director, the indemnity granted by the Partnership to the Director in Clause 14.1 shall
not extend to any liability (including any costs and expenses) incurred by, or attaching
to, the Director:

(i) owing to any member of the SET Group or any Members, including liabilities
resulting from any claim brought against such Director by such Persons;
provided that the Director shall be entitled to reasonable expenses (including
attorneys’ fees) incurred in connection with the defence of any such claim if
such Director is not adjudged liable;

54

15
15.1

14.2.2

14.2.3

14.2.4

14.2.5

(ii) to pay a fine imposed in criminal proceedings or to pay a penalty imposed by
any regulatory authority;

(iii) in connection with or in defending any criminal action or proceedings in which
he is convicted, where such conviction is final; or

(iv) resulting from such Director’s wilful misconduct.

The Partnership shall not be required to pay any amounts under this Clause 14 in
advance of a final disposition of the relevant action, suit or proceeding unless the
Partnership determines in its sole discretion (as provided in Clause 14.2.3) that such
advance is reasonable and appropriate and the Director claiming indemnification has
provided an undertaking to repay such amounts if the Partnership ultimately
determines that such Director is not entitled to be indemnified by the Partnership.

Any determination by the Partnership regarding the matters described in this Clause 14
shall be made by a committee of the Board consisting of the Directors who (i) are not
subject to the action, suit or proceeding giving rise to the liability for which
indemnification is sought and (ii) do not otherwise have any conflict of interest. If there
are no such Directors, such determination shall be made by the Members, with the
consent of at least one of the Sempra Members.

Furthermore, the indemnity provided for in this Clause 14 shall not apply to the extent
that it is prohibited by, or inconsistent with, Applicable Laws.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Partnership shall be relieved of its
obligation to indemnify any Director to the extent that any loss could have been
mitigated had such Director taken reasonable and apparent mitigating steps.

Competition with the Partnership

RBS Non-compete

15.1.1

Except for RBS Permitted Competitive Activities and except as provided in
Clause 15.1.3 or 15.1.4, RBS shall not, and shall procure that its Associated
Companies do not, for the duration of the Restricted Period, directly or indirectly
through partnerships, joint ventures or otherwise, conduct or engage in activities
comprising SET Core Businesses (including any activities resulting directly or indirectly
from any investment, acquisition or merger in which RBS, or its relevant Associated
Company, is the surviving entity other than any such transaction that is subject to
Clause 15.1.2 or 15.1.3) unless the Sempra Member Group has granted its prior
written consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if RBS and its Associated Companies
have made good faith efforts to comply with this Clause 15.1.1, RBS and its Associated
Companies shall not be deemed to have breached this Clause 15.1.1 in any Financial
Year if the aggregate Net Trading Revenue of RBS and its Associated Companies
during such Financial Year attributable to activities comprising SET Core Businesses is
less than $5,000,000; provided that, if in any Financial Year the aggregate Net Trading
Revenue of RBS and its Associated Companies during such Financial Year attributable
to activities comprising SET Core Businesses equals or exceeds $5,000,000, RBS
shall, and shall cause its Associated Companies to, payover any Net Trading Revenue
in excess of $5,000,000 to the Partnership promptly following the last day of such

55

15.1.2

15.1.3

Financial Year, and such excess shall be treated as income of the Partnership for the
purposes of calculating Adjusted Global Net Loss and Adjusted Global Net Income.

For the duration of the Restricted Period, RBS shall not, and shall not permit any
Associated Company to, directly or indirectly, own or acquire an equity interest of more
than twenty-five percent (25%) in any entity (or group of related entities or assets
constituting a line of business) that, together with its subsidiaries, engages in trading
activities that constitute SET Core Businesses if the Average Net Trading Revenue
attributable to such trading activities represent fifty percent (50%) or more of the
Average Net Trading Revenue of such entity (or group of related entities or line of
business) and its subsidiaries (such entity, group of related entities or line of business,
a “Major Competitor’).

For the duration of the Restricted Period, in the event that RBS or any Associated
Company of RBS, directly or indirectly, acquires (x) an equity interest of more than
thirty-three percent (33%) in a Public Entity, (y) an equity interest of more than forty-five
percent (45%) in a Non-Public Entity or (z) the right or ability (by voting power, contract
or otherwise) to elect or designate for election a majority of the board of directors (or
analogous body) of a Public Entity or Non-Public Entity (or the parent company of any
such entity), in each case that engages in trading activities that constitute or are
competitive with the SET Core Businesses but that is not a Major Competitor (a “Minor
Competitor’), then:

(i) RBS and Sempra Energy shall negotiate in good faith to combine such Minor
Competitor's activities with the activities of the SET Group. Such negotiations
shall include the structure of the combination, the amount of additional capital,
if any, to be Contributed by the Members in connection with such combination
and the adjustment of the allocation of distributions to Members hereunder in
order to reflect the value of such Minor Competitor; and

(ii) if RBS is unable to combine such activities with those of the SET Group, or if
RBS and Sempra Energy, acting in good faith, are unable to agree to the terms
of any such combination, within a period of six months from the date of the
consummation of such acquisition or investment by RBS or such Associated
Company, then:

(a) prior to entering into any transaction or series of related transactions
with, or directing any corporate opportunity to, such Minor Competitor
within the RBS Covered Areas that constitutes or is competitive with the
SET Core Businesses (each such transaction, series of related
transactions or corporate opportunity, an “RBS Core Transaction”), RBS
shall, and shall procure that its Associated Companies, make a good
faith effort to notify the Partnership of such RBS Core Transaction and
offer to the Partnership the opportunity, within a commercially reasonable
period of time, to submit an offer to RBS or such Associated Company
with respect to such RBS Core Transaction; provided that RBS and its
Associated Companies shall be free to accept or reject any offer made
by the Partnership hereunder; and

(b) _ if, subsequent to rejecting an offer made by the Partnership pursuant to
the preceding clause, RBS determines to engage in such RBS Core

56

15.1.4

15.1.5

Transaction with such Minor Competitor on terms more favourable to
such Minor Competitor than those specified in the Partnership’s offer,
RBS shall, or shall cause such Associated Company to, make a good
faith effort to notify the Partnership of such terms and offer to the
Partnership the opportunity, within a commercially reasonable period of
time, to submit a revised offer to RBS or such Associated Company with
respect to such RBS Core Transaction; provided that RBS and its
Associated Companies shall be free to accept or reject any revised offer
made by the Partnership hereunder; provided further that, if RBS or such
Associated Company rejects such revised offer, neither RBS nor such
Associated Company may enter into such RBS Core Transaction with
such Minor Competitor on terms that are identical in all material respects
to, or more favourable to such Minor Competitor than, the terms
specified in the Partnership’s revised offer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, RBS and its Associated Companies shall only
be required to comply with this Clause 15.1.3(ii) with respect to any RBS Core
Transaction that is reasonably expected at the time of execution to result in
gross purchases and sales of at least $100,000,000 in aggregate, and only with
respect to 75% of such RBS Core Transactions executed in any Financial Year.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Clause 15.1, (i) RBS and its Associated
Companies shall be permitted to sponsor, manage and advise private equity, hedge
and other types of funds and investment vehicles (collectively, “Funds’”), (ii) any such
Fund shall be permitted to own portfolio companies or securities of other portfolio
investments that engage in SET Core Businesses (whether or not competitive with the
SET Group) and (iii) RBS and its Associated Companies may own general partner,
managing member and other ownership interests in such Funds and the portfolio
companies and other portfolio investments thereof (including without limitation through
so-called “co-investment” and similar arrangements in connection with such Funds);
provided, in each case, that at all times (x) such Fund is a bona fide investment vehicle
formed to make multiple investments and (y) at least two-thirds of the capital of any
such Fund is invested by Persons other than RBS and its affiliates or Associated
Companies.

For the purposes of this Clause 15.1, the SET Core Businesses shall not include
Commodity Transactions in currencies and interest rates.

15.2 Sempra Non-compete

15.2.1

The parties acknowledge that Sempra Energy and its Associated Companies have in
the past engaged in Commodity Transactions, including Commodity Transactions
comprising SET Core Businesses, and will, in a manner consistent with this
Clause 15.2.1, continue to engage in such Commodity Transactions on and after the
date hereof. During the Restricted Period, prior to entering into any transaction or
series of related transactions, executed by or on behalf of any of the Sempra Covered
Units and comprising SET Core Businesses (each such transaction or series of related
transactions, a “Sempra Core Transaction”), with any Third Party Commodities
Trading Organisation, Sempra Energy shall, and shall procure that any relevant
Associated Company of Sempra Energy shall, if feasible, make a good faith effort to

57

15.2.2

15.2.3

notify the Partnership of (i) such Sempra Core Transaction and (ii) the terms Sempra
Energy or such Associated Company has negotiated or reasonably expects to
negotiate with respect to such Sempra Core Transaction; provided, however, that this
covenant shall bind Sempra Energy only with respect to any Sempra Core Transaction
that is reasonably expected at the time of execution to result in gross purchases and
sales of at least $100 million in aggregate, and only with respect to 75% of such
Sempra Core Transactions executed in any Financial Year. The Partnership, within a
reasonable time of receipt of such notice, shall have the right to engage in such
Sempra Core Transaction with Sempra Energy or such Associated Company on terms
identical in all material respects to, or more favourable to Sempra Energy or such
Associated Company than, those set forth in such notice. The Partnership shall
exercise such right by promptly notifying Sempra Energy or such Associated Company
and taking such further actions as are required to evidence such engagement and
perform the terms thereof. If the Partnership fails to promptly exercise such right or,
following exercise of such right, fails to promptly perform such actions as are required
hereunder, neither Sempra Energy nor such Associated Company shall have any
further obligation to the Partnership with regard to such transaction or series of related
transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Sempra Energy nor any
Associated Company thereof shall have any obligation to comply with this
Clause 15.2.1 if any resulting transaction would or is reasonably likely to violate or
conflict with Sempra Energy’s or such Associated Company's policies and practices
concerning concentration of credit or risk exposure, which shall be determined by
Sempra Energy or such Associated Company in its reasonable discretion.

For the duration of the Restricted Period, Sempra Energy shall not, and shall not permit
any Associated Company to, directly or indirectly, own or acquire an equity interest of
more than twenty-five percent (25%) in a Major Competitor.

For the duration of the Restricted Period, in the event that Sempra Energy or any
Associated Company of Sempra Energy, directly or indirectly, acquires (x) an equity
interest of more than thirty-three percent (33%) in a Public Entity, (y) an equity interest
of more than forty-five percent (45%) in a Non-Public Entity or (z) the right or ability (by
voting power, contract or otherwise) to elect or designate for election a majority of the
board of directors of a Public Entity or Non-Public Entity (or the parent company of any
such entity), in each case, that is a Minor Competitor, then:

(i) Sempra Energy and RBS shall negotiate in good faith to combine such Minor
Competitor's activities with the activities of the SET Group. Such negotiations
shall include the structure of the combination, the amount of additional capital,
if any, to be Contributed by the Members in connection with such combination
and the adjustment of the allocation of distributions to Members hereunder in
order to reflect the value of such Minor Competitor; and

(ii) if Sempra Energy is unable to combine such activities with those of the SET
Group, or if Sempra Energy and RBS, acting in good faith, are unable to agree
to the terms of any such combination, within a period of six months from the
date of the consummation of such acquisition or investment by Sempra Energy
or such Associated Company, then:

(a) prior to entering into any Sempra Core Transaction with such Minor
Competitor, Sempra Energy shall, and shall procure that its Associated

58

15.3

15.2.4

15.2.5

Companies, make a good faith effort to notify the Partnership of such
Sempra Core Transaction and offer to the Partnership the opportunity,
within a commercially reasonable period of time, to submit an offer to
Sempra Energy or such Associated Company with respect to such
Sempra Core Transaction; provided that Sempra Energy and its
Associated Companies shall be free to accept or reject any offer made
by the Partnership hereunder; and

(b) _ if, subsequent to rejecting an offer made by the Partnership pursuant to
the preceding clause, Sempra Energy determines to enter into such
Sempra Core Transaction with such Minor Competitor on terms more
favourable to such Minor Competitor than those specified in the
Partnership’s offer, Sempra Energy shall, or shall cause such Associated
Company to, make a good faith effort to notify the Partnership of such
terms and offer to the Partnership the opportunity, within a commercially
reasonable period of time, to submit a revised offer to Sempra Energy or
such Associated Company with respect to such Sempra Core
Transaction; provided that Sempra Energy and its Associated
Companies shall be free to accept or reject any revised offer made by
the Partnership hereunder; provided, further, that, if Sempra Energy or
such Associated Company rejects such revised offer, neither Sempra
Energy nor such Associated Company may enter into such Sempra Core
Transaction with such Minor Competitor on terms that are identical in all
material respects to, or more favourable to such Minor Competitor than,
the terms specified in the Partnership’s revised offer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sempra Energy and its Associated Companies
shall only be required to comply with this Clause 15.2.3(ii) with respect to any
Sempra Core Transaction that is reasonably expected at the time of execution
to result in gross purchases and sales of at least $100,000,000 in aggregate,
and only with respect to 75% of such Sempra Core Transactions executed in
any Financial Year.

For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding any provision of this Clause 15.2 to
the contrary, this Clause 15.2 shall not apply to any Sempra Utilities or any other
Person now owned by Sempra Energy or any of its Associated Companies or hereafter
acquired, that is subject to cost-based rate regulation and regulation as to service by
any state, federal or foreign governmental regulation and owns or operates
facilities used for (i) the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric energy for
sale, (ii) the distribution of natural or manufactured gas for heat, light, or power or (iii)
the collection, treatment and distribution of water for sale.

For the purposes of this Clause 15.2, the SET Core Businesses shall not include
Commodity Transactions in currencies and interest rates.

Termination of Noncompetition Covenants.

In the event that either RBS or Sempra Energy is acquired by another Person, which other
Person was not, prior to such acquisition, an Associated Company of such Person, the
provisions of Clauses 15.1 and 15.2 shall cease to apply to both RBS and the Sempra
Members.

59

15.4

15.5

15.6

Disputes

In the event that a dispute arises among the Members concerning whether any Member has
breached the terms of Clause 15.1 or 15.2, as applicable, the parties shall resolve such
dispute in accordance with the procedures set forth in Clause 19.2. If a Member admits that it
has, or is determined pursuant to such procedures to have, breached the provisions of
Clause 15.1 or 15.2, as applicable, such Member shall cease any such activities or operations
or dispose of such activities or operations as promptly as commercially practicable and shall
pay over the profits it has earned in connection with such activities or operations to the
Partnership, and such Member shall have no further liability hereunder for such breach.

No Hire

15.5.1 The Sempra Members agree that they will not, at any time while any Sempra Member
or Associated Company of Sempra Energy has any ownership interest in the
Partnership and for a period of one year from the date on which the Sempra Member
Group ceases to have any membership interest in the Partnership, solicit, endeavour to
entice away, employ or offer to employ any person who is, at such time, or has been
during the prior twelve (12) months, an employee, officer or manager of any member of
the SET Group; provided that this Clause 15.5.1 shall not, except with respect to
employees at or above the level of vice president (or who, within the preceding twelve
(12) months, had been employed at or above the level of vice president), prohibit the
general advertisement of employment opportunities not specifically targeting any
employee, officer or manager of any member of the SET Group, or any resulting
employment or offer of employment.

15.5.2 RBS (on behalf of the RBS Group) agrees that it will not, at any time while RBS or any
Associated Company of RBS has any ownership interest in the Partnership and for a
period of one year from the date on which the RBS Group ceases to have any
membership interest in the Partnership, directly or indirectly, solicit, endeavour to entice
away, employ or offer to employ any person who is, at such time, or has been during
the prior twelve (12) months, an employee, officer or manager of any member of the
SET Group; provided that this Clause 15.5.2 shall not, except with respect to
employees at or above the level of vice president (or who, within the preceding twelve
(12) months, had been employed at or above the level of vice president), prohibit the
general advertisement of employment opportunities not specifically targeting any
employee, officer or manager of any member of the SET Group, or any resulting
employment or offer of employment.

Invalidity

15.6.1 Each of the restrictions set forth in this Clause 15 is an entirely separate and
independent restriction on each party and the validity of one restriction shall not be
affected by the validity or unenforceability of another.

15.6.2 Each party considers the restrictions in this Clause 15 to be reasonable and necessary
for the protection of the interests of the Business. If any such restriction shall be held to
be void but would be valid if deleted in part or reduced in application, such restriction
shall apply with such deletion or modification as may be necessary to make it valid and
enforceable.

Term and Termination

Duration

Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, this Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect without limit in point of time until the parties agree in writing to terminate this
Agreement. Neither RBS nor the Sempra Members shall be permitted to resign from the
Partnership except as expressly provided in this Agreement, and the resignation and
replacement from time to time of a Designated Member shall not affect the continuity of the
Partnership between the remaining Members.

Termination

16.2.1

16.2.2

Termination of this Agreement shall not release a party from any liability which at the
time of termination has already accrued to the other party or which thereafter may
accrue in respect of any act or omission prior to such termination.

Clauses 1 and 17 to 19 shall survive termination of this Agreement.

Exit Rights and Tag-Along Rights

16.3.1

16.3.2

For the duration of the Restricted Period, no Member may Transfer its interest in the
Partnership except (i) as provided in Clause 4.7 and (ii) pursuant to a bona fide pledge
of or encumbrance on all or any portion of the distributions payable in connection with
such interest securing any Indebtedness of such Member to an unaffiliated third party
that is incurred for a purpose other than effecting the Transfer of such Member’s
interest in the Partnership or any part thereof.

In addition to each Member’s right to Transfer its interest in the Partnership in
accordance with Clause 16.3.1, at any time following the termination of the Restricted
Period, any Sempra Member may Transfer all, but not part, of its interest in the
Partnership as follows:

(i) Such Sempra Member shall notify RBS in writing (the “Outside Transfer
Notice’) of its intention to Transfer its interest in the Partnership (the “Offered
Interest’); provided that, if such Sempra Member has previously delivered an
Outside Transfer Notice, it may not deliver a subsequent Outside Transfer
Notice for a period of two (2) years following the date on which the most
recently delivered Outside Transfer Notice was delivered.

(ii) Within 180 days of receipt of the Outside Transfer Notice, RBS shall notify such
Sempra Member in writing as to whether RBS desires to purchase the Offered
Interest (an “Indication Notice”). Unless RBS has notified such Sempra
Member that RBS does not desire to purchase the Offered Interest, such
Sempra Member and RBS shall endeavour, during such period of 180 days, to
negotiate a purchase price for the Offered Interest, which price shall not exceed
an amount equal to the Exit Price Cap plus the amount of any distributions
payable to such Sempra Member pursuant to Clause 7.2 or 7.3.4 that have not
been distributed by the Partnership to such Sempra Member (other than
distributions that are treated as having been distributed pursuant to Clause
7.3.1, 7.3.2 or 9.1 or that are retained pursuant to Clause 7.3.3). If at any time
such Sempra Member determines not to Transfer the Offered Interest, such
Sempra Member may withdraw the Outside Transfer Notice, and thereafter,

61

(iii)

such Sempra Member shall not have any obligation to RBS under this
Clause 16.3.2 unless such Sempra Member delivers a subsequent Outside
Transfer Notice; provided that, if such Sempra Member withdraws such Outside
Transfer Notice, such Sempra Member shall not be permitted to Transfer the
Offered Interest pursuant to this Clause 16.3.2 unless such Sempra Member
once again delivers an Outside Transfer Notice.

If RBS and such Sempra Member determine, at any time during the period
specified in clause (ii), that they will not be able to agree to a purchase price, or
RBS and such Sempra Member have failed to agree to a purchase price within
the period specified in clause (ii), then RBS and such Sempra Member may
agree to submit to binding arbitration under Clause 19.2 (without giving effect to
the sixty (60) day negotiation period described in Clause 19.2.1). If RBS is
unwilling to proceed to arbitration at such time, RBS shall be deemed to have
delivered an Indication Notice stating that RBS does not desire to purchase the
Offered Interest. If, at the end of the period specified in clause (ii), RBS
delivers a written notice to such Sempra Member stating that RBS is willing to
proceed to arbitration, then such Sempra Member shall either consent to such
arbitration or shall be deemed to have withdrawn the Outside Transfer Notice
pursuant to the last sentence of clause (ii). If RBS and such Sempra Member
agree to submit to arbitration, such submission shall be deemed to be a binding
commitment by RBS to purchase the Offered Interest at the price determined
by the arbitration panel and such arbitration shall be conducted in a manner
consistent with this Clause 16.3.2(iii) and Clause 19.2; provided that:

(a) | The arbitration panel shall be instructed to determine solely the purchase
price of the Offered Interest. Such purchase price shall reflect the
amount that a willing buyer not under compulsion to buy would agree
with a willing seller not under compulsion to sell in an arm’s length
transaction and shall not include any discount or premium in respect of
control.

(b) | Each of RBS and such Sempra Member shall propose to the arbitration
panel a purchase price for the Offered Interest not greater than the Exit
Price Cap.

(c) The arbitration panel shall determine the purchase price of the Offered
Interest by selecting either the proposal of RBS or the proposal of such
Sempra Member and shall not consider the existence of the Exit Price
Cap in making such determination. The arbitration panel shall also
determine the amount of any distributions payable to such Sempra
Member pursuant to Clause 7.2 or 7.3.4 that have not been distributed
by the Partnership to such Sempra Member (other than distributions that
are treated as having been distributed pursuant to Clause 7.3.1, 7.3.2 or
9.1 or that are retained pursuant to Clause 7.3.3), and without regard for
the Exit Price Cap, such amount shall be added to the purchase price
proposal selected by the arbitration panel in accordance with the
preceding sentence.

(d) | The arbitration panel shall render its decision no later than 180 days
following the date on which RBS delivered the Arbitration Demand.

62

If RBS delivers an Indication Notice stating that RBS desires to purchase the
Offered Interest within the period specified in clause (ii) and RBS and such
Sempra Member agree to a purchase price during such period, then RBS and
such Sempra Member shall use reasonable endeavours to cause such Transfer
of the Offered Interest to close within 365 days of the date of such Indication
Notice. If RBS and such Sempra Member agree to submit to arbitration under
clause (iii), RBS shall, promptly following the rendering of a final decision by the
arbitration panel, enter into a binding agreement with such Sempra Member to
purchase the Offered Interest at the price determined by the arbitration panel
and RBS and such Sempra Member shall use reasonable endeavours to cause
such Transfer of the Offered Interest to close within 180 days of the rendering
of a final decision by the arbitration panel.

If RBS (a) does not deliver an Indication Notice within the period specified in
clause (ii) (except in the case that RBS and such Sempra Member agree to
submit to arbitration under clause (iii)), (b) delivers an Indication Notice stating
that RBS does not desire to purchase the Offered Interest (or is deemed to
have done so under clause (iii)) or (c) to the extent applicable, fails to promptly
perform such actions as are required by clause (iv), then such Sempra Member
shall be permitted, subject to clauses (vi) and (vii), for a period of 270 days
from the earlier of the date by which RBS was required to deliver an Indication
Notice and the date on which RBS delivered (or was deemed to have
delivered) an Indication Notice stating that RBS does not desire to purchase
the Offered Interest, to enter into a binding contract to Transfer the Offered
Interest to any Person on such terms and conditions as such Sempra Member
may negotiate.

Promptly upon such Sempra Member becoming entitled to Transfer the Offered
Interest to a third party pursuant to clause (v), such Sempra Member shall
deliver a notice to RBS setting forth the most favourable terms and conditions
on which such Sempra Member was willing to Transfer the Offered Interest to
RBS. If such Sempra Member determines to Transfer the Offered Interest to a
third party in accordance with clause (v) on terms and conditions more
favourable to such third party than the terms and conditions set forth in the
notice delivered pursuant to the preceding sentence, such Sempra Member
shall, prior to Transferring the Offered Interest to such third party, notify RBS in
writing of the terms and conditions on which such Sempra Member proposes to
Transfer the Offered Interest to such third party. RBS, within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such notice, shall have the right to purchase the Offered Interest on
terms and conditions identical in all material respects to, or more favourable to
such Sempra Member than, the terms and conditions on which such Sempra
Member was willing to Transfer the Offered Interest to such third party. RBS
shall exercise such right by notifying such Sempra Member in writing and
taking such further actions as are required to close such Transfer within 180
days of the date on with RBS exercises such right. If RBS fails to exercise
such right within the thirty (30) day period specified above or, following exercise
of such right, fails to promptly perform such actions as are required hereunder,
such Sempra Member shall have no further obligation to RBS with regard to
such Transfer and may Transfer the Offered Interest to such third party in

63

(vii)

(viii)

accordance with clause (v) on terms and conditions identical in all material
respects to, or no more favourable to such third party than, the terms and
conditions specified in the notice described above. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if such Sempra Member became entitled to Transfer the Offered
Interest to a third party pursuant to clause (v)(c), then such Sempra Member
shall not be required to comply with this clause (vi).

If such Sempra Member determines to Transfer the Offered Interest to a third
party in accordance with clause (v) and such third party (i) is a bank, bank
holding company, registered broker-dealer or Associated Company of any of
the foregoing, (ii) is a hedge fund controlled by, or whose holding company is,
either a bank, bank holding company or registered broker-dealer or (iii) has a
credit rating from a Ratings Agency lower than the then-current rating of the
long-term unsecured unsubordinated debt of Sempra Energy, then such third
party must be acceptable to RBS, in RBS’s sole discretion.

If such Sempra Member determines to Transfer the Offered Interest to a third
party in accordance with clause (v), RBS and the Partnership shall, and shall
cause their Associated Companies to, provide reasonable access to all relevant
books, records and personnel of the Partnership and its representatives to the
extent such Sempra Member or such third party reasonably requests such
information and access; provided that RBS and the Partnership may require,
prior to providing such access, that such third party agree to maintain the
confidentiality of such information on terms consistent with Clause 17.

Notwithstanding any provision of this Clause 16.3.2 to the contrary:

(a) Subject to the provisions of the next sentences, if RBS agrees to
purchase the Offered Interest pursuant to this Clause 16.3.2, the
purchase price for such Offered Interest shall not, in any event, exceed
$5,000,000,000. The provisions of the foregoing sentence are for the
benefit of the RBS Member Group alone and may, within thirty (30) days
of receipt of an Outside Transfer Notice or a notice pursuant to
clause (vi), be waived by RBS at its sole discretion (whether entirely or
subject to a higher cap determined by RBS). To the extent that, at the
time of such waiver, RBS or any of its holding companies remains
subject to laws or regulations requiring transactions above a certain size
to be approved by RBS’s, or such holding company’s, as the case may
be, shareholders before such transactions are implemented, such waiver
shall only be effective to the extent that either: (x) the waiver does not
result in such a requirement being triggered or (y) the waiver does trigger
such a requirement but the relevant shareholder approval is obtained
within sixty (60) days of the waiver (and the receipt of such approval or,
in its absence, the expiry of such sixty (60) day period shall be a
condition to the completion of such purchase).

(b) | Clause (ix)(a) shall not in any manner restrict such Sempra Member’s
right to value and negotiate for the sale of the Offered Interest at such
purchase price as such Sempra Member, in its sole discretion, may
determine. If as a result of clause (ix)(a), RBS (or its holding company)
is required, as a condition to completing a purchase of the Offered

64

Interest, seek approval from its shareholders, (x) RBS shall, or shall
procure that its holding company, if applicable, recommend such
transaction to its shareholders and (y) if such shareholder approval is not
obtained within the period of time set forth in clause (ix)(a), (A) RBS shall
be deemed to have delivered an Indication Notice, on the date that such
failure to satisfy the closing condition caused such purchase not to close,
stating that RBS does not desire to purchase the Offered Interest, and
the 270-day period specified in clause (v) shall be deemed to start (or
restart) on such date and (B) all restrictions under this Agreement on any
Sempra Member's (or successor’s) ability to Transfer any interest in the
Partnership shall cease to be applicable.

16.3.3. Any third party who purchases an interest in the Partnership from any Sempra Member
(the “Successor Member’) shall be subject to the following restrictions on Transfer of
such Successor Member’s interest in the Partnership.

16.3.4

(i)

(iii)

For a period of three (3) years following such Successor Member’s admission
to the Partnership, such Successor Member shall not be permitted to Transfer
its interest in the Partnership except (i) as provided in Clause 4.7 and
(ii) pursuant to a bona fide pledge of or encumbrance on all or any portion of
the distributions payable in connection with such interest securing any
Indebtedness of such Successor Member to an unaffiliated third party that is
incurred for a purpose other than effecting the Transfer of such Successor
Member’s interest in the Partnership or any part thereof.

Such Successor Member shall be subject to the provisions of Clause 16.3.2,
with the following modifications:

(a) each reference to a Sempra Member shall be deemed to be a reference
to such Successor Member;

(b) the words “at any time following the termination of the Restricted Period”
shall be deemed to be replaced with the words “at any time following the
third anniversary of a Successor Member’s admission to the
Partnership;”

(c) any reference to Clause 16.3.1 shall be deemed to be a reference to
Clause 16.3.3(i); and

(d) each reference to the Exit Price Cap shall be deemed to be a reference
to the Successor Exit Price Cap.

The effectiveness of this Clause 16.3 shall cease at such time as neither RBS
nor any Associated Company thereof is a Member.

In addition to each Member’s right to Transfer its interest in the Partnership in
accordance with Clause 16.3.1, at any time following the termination of the Restricted
Period, RBS or any RBS Member may Transfer all, but not part, of its interest in the
Partnership to a third party (the “Acquiror’) as follows:

(i)

RBS shall notify each Sempra Member of RBS’s intention to Transfer such
interest, and each Sempra Member shall have the right to submit to RBS an
offer, within thirty (30) days, to purchase such Partnership interest. RBS shall

65

be free to accept or reject any offer made by any Sempra Member hereunder;
provided, however, that, if RBS rejects such offer, RBS may only Transfer its
interest in the Partnership to any Acquiror on terms and conditions that are no
more favourable to such Acquiror than the terms and conditions specified in
such Sempra Member’s offer. RBS shall be permitted, for a period of 270 days
from the date on which RBS notifies the Sempra Members of its intention to
Transfer such Partnership Interest, to enter into a binding contract to Transfer
such Partnership Interest to any Person who is reasonably acceptable to the
Sempra Members on such terms and conditions as such RBS may negotiate.

RBS shall provide the Sempra Member Group with not less than thirty (30)
days prior written notice of any proposed sale to an Acquiror, including the
identity of the Acquiror and all of the material terms and conditions thereof.
RBS shall procure that, upon receipt of such notice, the Sempra Member
Group shall have the right (subject to compliance with Applicable Laws), but not
the obligation, to Transfer its interest in the Partnership to the Acquiror on the
same terms and conditions (to the extent reasonably applicable), and at the
same time, as those on which RBS is Transferring its interest; provided that no
Sempra Member shall be required to cause any Sempra Utility to take any
action that is restricted under Applicable Law in order for the Sempra Member
Group to exercise its right under this clause (ii). If the Sempra Member Group
elects to Transfer its interest in the Partnership to the Acquiror pursuant to this
Clause 16.3.4(ii), the purchase price paid by such Acquiror shall be divided
among the Members as follows:

first, each Member shall receive an amount equal to the book value of
any trading positions relating to the SET Business that are on the books
of RBS or the SET Group, but only to the extent (x) of any funding in
respect of the Business or SET Business provided by such Member to
the SET Group (other than the Adjusted Contribution Amounts) and (y)
such funding was not assumed by the Acquiror in connection with the
purchase of the Partnership;

second, each Member shall receive a portion of the purchase price equal
to such Member’s Adjusted Contribution Amount (or, if the purchase price
is less than the aggregate Adjusted Contribution Amounts of the
Members, then each Member shall receive a portion of the purchase
price proportionate to such Member’s Adjusted Contribution Amount as a
percentage of the aggregate Adjusted Contribution Amounts of the
Members);

third, any amount of the purchase price remaining shall be divided
among the Members in proportion to the average, over the preceding two
(2) full Financial Years, of the Sempra Maximum Entitlement or the RBS
Maximum Entitlement, as applicable, as a percentage of the average,
over such period, of the sum of the Sempra Maximum Entitlement and
the RBS Maximum Entitlement;

in each case, determined as of the last day of the most recently completed
month, as though such month end were the end of the Financial Year.

66

16.3.5

If the Sempra Member Group chooses to exercise such right, it shall provide
written notice to the Acquiror and to RBS within twenty (20) days of receipt of
the notice informing them of such sale and, upon receipt, all parties shall be
deemed to have consented to such Transfers.

If, at any time, one but not both of the Sempra Members (or any Successor Member)
determines to Transfer its interest in the Partnership pursuant to Clause 16.3.2 (or
16.3.3), the Sempra Members (or such Successor Member) and RBS shall negotiate in
good faith to make such changes to this Agreement, and in particular to the provisions
of Clause 16.3.2 (or 16.3.3), as may be necessary or desirable to (i) accommodate
such Transfer by a single Sempra Member (or such Successor Member), (ii) provide
for, if applicable, the admission of an additional Member that is not an Associated
Company of either Sempra Energy (or, if applicable, such Successor Member) or RBS
and (iii) equitably allocate any aggregate limitations applicable to the Sempra Member
Group (or such Successor Member) to the individual Sempra Members (or any
Successor Member).

16.4 Liquidation of the Partnership

16.4.1

The “Sempra Liquidation Amount” and the “RBS Liquidation Amount” shall equal
the amounts that the Sempra Members (in the aggregate) and RBS, respectively,
would receive if the Partnership were to, hypothetically, liquidate and distribute its
assets in the manner set forth below.

(i) First, the Partnership shall calculate the amount of assets that would be
distributed to each Member as if the following priority applied to determine how
the assets of the Partnership are to be applied:

(a) _ first, to provide for the payment of all liabilities of the Partnership;

(b) second, to distribute to each Member any distributions payable to such
Member pursuant to Clause 7.2 that have not been distributed by the
Partnership to such Member (excluding distributions that have been
withheld or retained pursuant to Clause 7.3 or 9.1);

(c) _ third, to return to each Member with a positive Adjusted Contribution
Amount an amount equal to the Adjusted Contribution Amount of such
Member; and

(d) fourth, to allocate (in accordance with Clause 7.1) and distribute (in
accordance with Clause 7.2) to each Member as though the fair market
value of such assets were Adjusted Global Net Income.

(ii) Second, if any Member has a negative Adjusted Contribution Amount
immediately prior to the liquidation of the Partnership:

(a) the Partnership shall retain from any distributions otherwise payable to
such Member pursuant to clause (i) assets with a fair market value equal
to the lesser of (a) the absolute value of such negative Adjusted
Contribution Amount and (b) the total amount of distributions otherwise
payable to such Member pursuant to clause (i); and

(b) following the distribution of the other assets of the Partnership in

67

17
17.1

16.4.2

16.4.3

16.4.4

accordance with clause (i)(a) through (d), any assets retained pursuant
to clause (ii)(a) shall then be allocated (in accordance with Clause 7.1)
and distributed (in accordance with Clause 7.2) to each Member, without
regard to the balance of any Member’s Adjusted Contribution Amount as
though the fair market value of such assets were Adjusted Global Net
Income.

On liquidation of the Partnership, the Partnership shall calculate the Sempra
Liquidation Amount and the RBS Liquidation Amount in accordance with Clause 16.4.1
and then apply the assets of the Partnership in the following priority:

(i) first, to provide for the payment of all liabilities of the Partnership;

(ii) second, to distribute, simultaneously, (a) the RBS Liquidation Amount to RBS
and (b) the Sempra Liquidation Amount to SG and SETI, pro rata in proportion
to their respective positive Capital Accounts.

On liquidation of the Partnership, the Partnership shall, to the extent available on such
date, distribute only assets used in the US Business, cash or both to SG, and shall, to
the extent available on such date, distribute only assets used in the Non-US Business,
cash or both to SETI.

If either Sempra Member has a negative Capital Account on liquidation, then such
Sempra Member shall have an unconditional obligation to Contribute to the Partnership
(on the date on which liquidation payments are made to the Members pursuant to
Clause 16.4.2(ii)) an amount of cash equal to the lesser of (i) the absolute value of
such Sempra Member’s Capital Account, (ii) the value of the other Sempra Member’s
Capital Account, if such value is equal to or greater than zero, or (iii) zero, if the other
Sempra Member’s Capital Account is less than zero.

such actions (or forebear from taking such actions) as may be reasonably required in

to this Agreement, the Commodities Trading Activities Master Agreement or any other

19.2.8

Within thirty (30) days of the delivery of an Arbitration Demand, the Sempra Members,
collectively, and RBS shall each simultaneously select one person to act as arbitrator,
but if either the Sempra Members or RBS shall fail to appoint an arbitrator within such
period, the AAA shall appoint such arbitrator. The arbitrators chosen (or deemed to be
chosen) by the Sempra Members and RBS shall attempt to agree upon a third
arbitrator, but if they fail to do so within fifteen (15) days after the appointment of the
party-appointed arbitrators, then either the Sempra Members or RBS may request that
the AAA appoint the third arbitrator. The third arbitrator (however chosen) shall be a
citizen of a country other than the United Kingdom or the United States and shall
preside over the arbitration proceedings. Prior to the commencement of hearings,
each of the arbitrators shall provide an oath or undertaking of impartiality.

The arbitration panel selected under Clause 19.2.2 shall have full power to decide any
disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim referred to in Clause 19.2.1 as well as
whether such disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim is within the scope of
Clause 19.2.1. All decisions of such panel shall be by majority vote. The decision of
the arbitration panel shall be final and binding upon the parties to the disagreement,
dispute, controversy or claim, and judgement may be enforced upon the award in any
court of competent jurisdiction.

The place of the arbitration shall be New York, New York, and the arbitration shall be
conducted in the English language.

The arbitration panel may apportion the costs of arbitration in its award, as provided in
the AAA Rules.

Any party may apply to the arbitrator seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award
is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Any party also may, without
waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any
interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that
party, prior to the constitution of the arbitration panel or pending the arbitration panel’s
determination of the merits of the controversy.

The International Bar Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
Commercial Arbitration (“IBA Rules”) shall apply together with the AAA Rules, and
where the IBA Rules are inconsistent with the AAA Rules, the IBA Rules shall prevail
but solely as regards the presentation and reception of evidence. The arbitration panel
provided for herein shall control any pre-hearing exchange of information, including,
but not limited to, the right to require the parties to exchange documents or make any
Person subject to their control available for deposition or interview before the hearing.
The parties further agree that the parties shall have the right in advance of any hearing
to take the deposition of (i) any Person who is to be called as a witness in the
arbitration and (ii) upon good cause being shown to the arbitration panel provided for
herein, any Person under the control of a party.

Each party hereto irrevocably and unconditionally, with respect to enforcement of any
final decision rendered by the arbitration panel under Clause 19.2.3 and interim relief
under Clause 19.2.6:

(i) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or proceeding relating to
this Agreement, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgement in respect
thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the State of New York and

74

(iii)

England;

consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such courts and
waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any
such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding
was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim the
same;

agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may be
effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its address set out in
Clause 18.9;

agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service of process in
any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other
jurisdiction;

agrees that equitable remedies in any action or proceeding referred to in this

Clause 19.2.8 will be acceptable and agrees that any Party shall be entitled to
such remedy in respect of the enforcement of such Party’s rights herein; and

waives to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it may have to
claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in this Clause 19.2
any special, exemplary, or punitive damages.
