disclose such information to the other Party under the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Agreement, the Party receiving Confidential Information ("Receiving Party") from the disclosing Party
("Disclosing Party") shall (i) treat all Confidential Information disclosed by the Disclosing Party as secret

and confidential and shall not disclose all or any portion of the Confidential Information to any other
Person, except as provided in section 1.1(b), (ii) not use any of such Confidential Information except in
the performance of the Receiving Party's covenants and obligations or otherwise as contemplated under
this Agreement, and (iii) restrict access to Confidential Information to the Receiving Party's employees
(including contractors, accountants and counsel and similar representatives) who have a need to know
such information in connection with the performance of the Receiving Party's obligations and covenants
under this Agreement and shall be responsible to ensure that such employees maintain the terms of
confidentiality and nonuse as required in this Agreement.

(b) In the event that either Party desires to use a third-party service provider ("Service Provider"),
including, for example, an engineering design firm or a contract manufacturer, to develop or produce the
Product using Technology or Technology Improvements, all Parties to this Agreement must first enter
into at least an acceptable non-disclosure and technology ownership agreement with the Service Provider.
Neither Party to this Agreement may disclose any Confidential Information to a Service Provider unless
(i) both Parties to this Agreement have individually entered into a non-disclosure agreement with the
Service Provider and (ii) the Service Provider has a presence in the United States and is able to be served
legal documents in the United States or agrees, in writing, that it can be served and that United States
Courts have personal jurisdiction over the Service Provider.

2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Confidential Information shall not include any
information that: (a) is presently in the Receiving Party's possession, provided that such information has
not been obtained from the Disclosing Party and that such possession can be demonstrated by the
Receiving Party's written records; (b) is, or becomes, generally available to the public through no act or
omission of the Receiving Party; (c) is received by the Receiving Party in written form from a third party
having no binding obligation to keep such information confidential; or (d) is required to be disclosed by
law, upon the advice of legal counsel.

3. Specific Confidential Information shall not be deemed to be available to the public or in the
possession of the Receiving Party merely because it is embraced by more general information so available
or in said Receiving Party's possession, nor shall a combination or aggregation of features which form
confidential information be deemed to be non-confidential merely because the individual features,
without being combined or aggregated, are non-confidential.

4. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that all written or other tangible forms of Confidential
Information (including any materials generated by the Receiving Party related to any Confidential
Information) shall be and remain the property of its owner and shall be promptly returned to the owner
upon the written request of the owner.

5. Neither the Agreement nor the disclosure of any information by the Disclosing Party shall be
deemed to constitute by implication or otherwise, a vesting of any title or interest or a grant of any
license, immunity or other right to the Receiving Party with regard to the Confidential Information.
Additionally, except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the execution of the Agreement shall not
operate, directly or indirectly, to grant to either Party any rights under any patent, trade secret or know-
how now or hereafter owned by or licensed to the other Party.

6. Each Party warrants that it is the rightful owner of the Confidential Information to be disclosed
under this Agreement and that it has the lawful right to make such disclosure.

7. In the event that the Receiving Party or any of its representatives are requested or required to
disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a subpoena or an order of a court or government agency,
the Receiving Party shall (a) promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the existence, terms and

circumstances surrounding the governmental request or requirements; (b) consult with the Disclosing
Party on the advisability of taking steps to resist or narrow the request; (c) if disclosure of Confidential
Information is required, furnish only such portion of the Confidential Information as the Receiving Party
is advised by counsel is legally required to be disclosed; and (d) cooperate with the Disclosing Party in its
efforts to obtain an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment be accorded to that portion
of the Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed.

Because money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Section of the Agreement
by the Receiving Party, the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction
and specific performance, as a remedy for any such breach of this Section. Such remedy shall not be
deemed to be the exclusive remedy for a breach of this Section of the Agreement by the Receiving Party
but shall be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity to the Disclosing Party. In the
event of litigation relating to the Agreement, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
Receiving Party has breached this Section of the Agreement, then the Receiving Party shall be liable and
pay to the Disclosing Party the reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other reasonable expenses of
litigation, including any appeal therefrom. The Receiving Party further agrees to waive any requirement
for the posting of a bond in connection with any such equitable relief.

No Liability to Third Parties. The debts, obligations, and liabilities of either Joint Ventures, whether
arising in contract, tort or otherwise, shall be solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of such Joint
Ventures, and no other Party shall be obligated for any such debt, obligation or liability of such Joint
Venturer solely by reason of being a party to this Agreement or an equity holder of a JV Company.

Deadlock. In the event the Joint Venturers are divided on a material issue and cannot agree on the
conduct of the business and affairs of the Joint Venture, then a deadlock between the Joint Venturers shall
be deemed to have occurred. Upon the occurrence of a deadlock, one Joint Ventures (hereinafter referred
to as the "Offeror") may elect to purchase the Joint Venture interest of the other Joint Ventures
(hereinafter referred to as the "Offeree") at a price calculated as the Offeree's percentage interest in a total
purchase price for all of the assets of the Joint Venture. The Offeror shall notify the Offeree in writing of
the offer to purchase, stating the total purchase price for all the assets of the Joint Venture, and the price
offered for the Offeree's Joint Venture interest expressed as the Offeree's percentage interest in the Joint
Venture assets multiplied by the total purchase price for all of the assets of the Joint Venture. The Offeree
shall have the right to buy the interest of the Offeror at the designated price and terms, or to sell the
Offeree's interest to the Offeror at the designated price and terms, whichever the Offeree may elect. The
offer, when made by the Offeror, is irrevocable for thirty (30) days. The Offeree shall have ten (10) days
from the receipt of such offer to make its election, that is, either to buy such interest of the Offeror or to
sell its own interest, which shall be made in writing executed by the Offeree and stating the nature of the
election. A Joint Venturer which is obligated to purchase the interest of another Joint Venturer pursuant to
the provisions hereof shall have twenty (20) days from the date of receipt of the written election from
such other Joint Venturer to pay the designated price and satisfy the terms of such purchase. Should the
Joint Venturer who has received an offer to sell or buy fail to make the election required herein in a
timely fashion, then such non-responding party shall be deemed to have elected and agreed to sell or buy,
as the case may be, according to the terms of the offer.

Legal Title to the Joint Venture. The Joint Venturers agree that the legal title to the Joint Venture
property and assets, including the Joint Venture itself, shall remain in the name of the Joint Venture.

Transfers Of Joint Venturers' Interests. Except as otherwise expressly permitted herein, no Joint
Venturer may sell, transfer, assign or encumber its interest in the Joint Venture, or admit additional Joint
Venturers, without the prior written consent of the other Joint Venturer. Any attempt to transfer or
encumber any interest in the Joint Venture in violation of this Section shall be null and void.

or default shall be deemed or construed to be a waiver of, or consent to, any future breach or default.
