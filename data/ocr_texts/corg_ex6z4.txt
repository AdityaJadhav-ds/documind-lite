disclosing party. Each party agrees that it shall hold the other's Proprietary Information in
the strictest confidence and shall use such Proprietary Information only in connection with
its performance under this Agreement. Each of them further agrees that it shall not
disclose the other's Proprietary Information internally except to that minimum number of

non-breaching party would be irreparably and immediately harmed and that money
damages would not be a sufficient remedy for any such breach. It is accordingly agreed
that the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including injunction
and specific performance, in the event of any breach of the provisions of Paragraph 13(g),
in addition to all other remedies available to such party at law or in equity.
