products shall be added to Exhibit F hereto and shall be CrimzonConnects Products. For
the avoidance of doubt, Seller understands and agrees that Purchaser 2 may reasonably
withhold approval for any CrimzonConnects products that directly compete with

above in this Section 1.08, Seller shall not have the right to grant any sublicenses under
Article 1.0 without Seller's prior written consent.

IC PRODUCT SALES / DELIVERY OF LICENSED DATA

Purchaser 2 shall make available for purchase by Seller IC products incorporating the
Licensed Data and firmware Licensed Technology as specified by Seller (subject to
available memory capacity on such IC products) ("IC Products") for incorporation by
Seller into the CrimzonConnects Products, including without limitation the IC Products
set forth on Exhibit E. Additionally, for purposes of enabling updates to the Licensed
Data, Purchaser 2 shall deliver to Seller such specified Licensed Data (subject to
available memory capacity on such IC Products), as set forth in Article 3.0 below.

LICENSED DATA UPDATES / ONLINE AVAILABILITY

During the term of this Agreement, Purchaser 2 shall maintain the Library in

IR Codes and any "published new codes" as used herein shall be limited to only those
codes that are publicly available.

In addition, on an exception basis and by special request, Purchaser 2 shall capture and
format and, within ten (10) business days after such capture, provide Seller (via
Purchaser 2's online database system) with those IR Codes that Seller shall specify from
time to time. Such requests by Seller shall be limited to no more than three (3) IR Codes
per calendar quarter. In the event that Purchaser 2 is unable to reasonably obtain such
requested IR Codes, Seller shall assist Purchaser 2 in obtaining such device or devices to
enable Purchaser 2 to capture, format, and provide Seller with such requested IR Codes.

Seller agrees that all such new IR Codes provided to Seller pursuant to this Article 3.0

ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

Seller understands that the delivery format under this Agreement is an existing Purchaser
2 standard product, and that no Purchaser 2 software development work or testing of
Seller implementation of the IC Products or Library is included in the fees and payments
listed in Article 5.0 below. In the event that Seller wishes Purchaser 2 to perform special
software development or testing for this or additional Seller projects or products which
would utilize the Licensed Patents or Licensed Data, this will be at an extra cost to be
negotiated by the parties.

In addition, at the request and expense of Seller, Purchaser 2 will provide commercially
reasonable consulting and advice to assist Seller in the use of the Licensed Data. In the
event that the IR Codes provided to Seller and the functions contained with the
CrimzonConnects Product prove to be too large to fit into available memory storage in
the CrimzonConnects Product, Purchaser 2 will assist Seller in determining which subset
of IR Codes provide (in Purchaser 2's commercially reasonable opinion) the greatest
market coverage, as well as which functions (in Purchaser 2's commercially reasonable
opinion) are the most popular for each device type.

FEES AND PAYMENTS

In consideration for the rights granted by Purchaser 2 to Seller under this Agreement,
Seller agrees to purchase at least one IC Product for inclusion in each CrimzonConnects
Product at the per unit price set forth in Exhibit E hereto.

Within thirty (30) days after the end of each calendar quarter (the "Fee Period"), Seller
shall pay to Purchaser 2 all quarterly maintenance fees (the "Quarterly Maintenance
Fees" as set forth in Section 5.03 below) accruing to Purchaser 2 for the prior quarter.
All payments hereunder shall be in United States Dollars.

Quarterly Maintenance. In order to remain eligible for access to Purchaser 2's online
database system, Seller shall pay Quarterly Maintenance Fees to Purchaser 2, as set forth
on Exhibit E, throughout the term of this Agreement. Purchaser 2 shall not be obligated
to supply Seller with access to Purchaser 2's online database pursuant to Article 3.0 after
the Fee Period in any quarter if the Quarterly Maintenance Fee for the prior quarter was
not paid by Seller during the Fee Period. It is understood by Seller that the Quarterly
Maintenance Fee shall constitute a maintenance fee and not a prepayment of future
royalties due.

the APA, upon the Effective Date, Seller agrees and acknowledges that (as between

Purchaser 2 in writing from time to time with respect to any CrimzonConnects Product

disclosed under this Agreement that are confidential or proprietary to the party
disclosing the information (the "Disclosing Party") to the other party (the "Receiving
Party"), regardless of whether such information is marked CONFIDENTIAL or the like.
The Receiving Party shall use the same degree of care to avoid disclosure of the
Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as the Receiving Party employs with respect
to its own proprietary or confidential information of like importance. Information shall
not be deemed Confidential Information and the Receiving Party shall not have the
foregoing obligations under this Section 8.01 with respect to any information which:

(i) prior to disclosure to the Receiving Party, was already in the Receiving Party's
possession on a non-confidential basis, as evidenced by written records kept by
the Receiving Party in the ordinary course of its business or as evidenced by
actual prior use by the Receiving Party;

(ii) at the time of disclosure to the Receiving Party, had previously been published
and is a part of the public domain;

(iii) after having been disclosed to the Receiving Party, is published and is a part of
the public domain, unless such publication is through the fault of or the breach by
the Receiving Party of its obligations under this Agreement;

(iv) | subsequent to disclosure to the Receiving Party, is obtained by the Receiving
Party on a non-confidential basis from a third party who is lawfully in possession
of such information and who is not in violation of any contractual or other legal or

Disclosing Party's Confidential Information as evidenced by written records kept
by the Receiving Party in the ordinary course of its business.

The Receiving Party shall have the burden of proof with respect to any of the above
events on which the Receiving Party relies as relieving it of its foregoing obligations
under this Section 8.01. Notwithstanding the foregoing, disclosure of such Confidential
Information shall not be precluded if such disclosure is in response to a valid order of a
court or other governmental body of the United States, any state therein, or any political
subdivision thereof or as otherwise required to be disclosed by law, regulation or
administrative rule; provided, however, that the Receiving Party shall first have given

appropriate protective order.

Seller that the Licensed Data will perform in accordance with Purchaser 2's published
specifications, as the same may be modified from time to time; provided that Seller
understands and agrees that Purchaser 2 does not warrant the Licensed Data will operate
uninterrupted or error free. Seller further understands and agrees that the Licensed Data
is by no means invulnerable to network interference and consequently no expressed or
implied warranty is made by Purchaser 2 against such occurrences. If Seller discovers

specifications during the term of this Agreement, Purchaser 2 shall (subject to the
limitations of warranty set forth herein), at its own expense (further subject to the
limitations of warranty set forth herein), promptly correct such defects, errors or non-
conformity by, among other things, supplying Seller with such corrections or making
such additions, modifications or adjustments as Purchaser 2 deems reasonably necessary
to keep the Licensed Data in operating order in conformity with the warranty provided
by this Article 9.0. Subject to Section 12.11, this warranty is not transferable without the

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, during the term of the Agreement and
so long as Seller notifies Purchaser 2 in a timely fashion of the existence of any claim,
suit, or proceeding, Purchaser 2 hereby assumes all liability for, and shall indemnify and
defend Seller and its officers, directors, agents, and employees with respect to any claim,
suit, or proceeding brought against Seller, and pay all reasonable expenses related

Notwithstanding any of the above, Seller shall have the right, at its own election, to
supersede Purchaser 2 in the defense of any such claim, suit or action and thereafter to
assume and conduct the same according to Seller's sole discretion, in which event
Purchaser 2 shall be released from any obligation arising from such claim, suit or action
under the foregoing portion of this Section 10.01. Should the Licensed Data or the IC
Products become, or in Purchaser 2's reasonable opinion be likely to become, the subject
of a claim for which Purchaser 2 is required to indemnify pursuant to this Section 10.01,
Purchaser 2 shall, at its discretion, (a) obtain for Seller, at no additional cost to Seller, the
right to continue using the affected component of the Licensed Data and the IC Products
(the "Affected Technology") under this Agreement, (b) modify the Affected Technology
and provide such modified Affected Technology at no additional cost to Seller to avoid
such claim, or (c) if neither (a) or (b) is commercially feasible, terminate the license to

Maintenance Fees) for the Affected Technology.

Exclusions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser 2 shall have no obligation to
indemnify Seller for any liability arising out of or relating to any allegations or claims of
infringement, to the extent the alleged infringement: (a) arises from any modification to
the Licensed Data or the IC Products made by, for, or at the request of Seller without the
written approval of Purchaser 2 (provided that in the absence of such modification the
Licensed Data or the IC Products would not otherwise infringe); (b) arises from any
combination or use of the Licensed Data or the IC Products, or portions thereof, with any
hardware, software, product, materials, files, data or processes or other hardware unless
Purchaser 2 sold, made or specifically recommended or approved them all as a
combination (provided that in the absence of such combination or use the Licensed Data

or the IC Products would not otherwise infringe); (c) arises from Seller's use of the
Licensed Data or the IC Products other than in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement; (iv) arises from any materials, information, software or content provided by
Seller ("Seller-Provided Materials") (provided that in the absence of such Seller-
Provided Materials the Licensed Data or the IC Products would not otherwise infringe);
or (v) arises from Seller continuing allegedly infringing activity after being notified
thereof or after being informed of modifications that would have avoided the alleged
infringement (collectively the "Excluded Claims").

THIS ARTICLE 10.0 STATES PURCHASER 2'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND
SELLER'S EXCLUSIVE REMEDY FOR ANY CLAIMED, POTENTIAL OR
ACTUAL INFRINGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, PURCHASER 2'S TOTAL
LIABILITY UNDER THIS ARTICLE 10.0 SHALL NOT EXCEED THE VALUE OF
ALL FEES PAID TO PURCHASER 2 BY SELLER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

TERMINATION

Term. Unless otherwise terminated pursuant to the provisions of this Article 11.0, this
Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and remain in effect in perpetuity.

Termination: Transfer. Either party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
immediately by delivering to the other party written notice of such termination in the
event of any attempted transfer or assignment by the other party of the entire Agreement
in violation of Section 12.11 below.

Continuing Rights Upon Insolvency. Upon the occurrence of any of the following
events with respect to Purchaser 2: (a) bankruptcy or liquidation; (b) assignment or
transfer of the business to a trustee for the benefit of creditors; (c) termination of its
business or dissolution, Seller shall have the continuing right to use the Purchaser 2
Licensed IP for the remaining duration of this Agreement, so long as Seller is not

Termination: Breach. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in order
for either party (the "Non-Defaulting Party") to terminate this Agreement for the failure
of the other party (the "Defaulting Party") to materially perform or adhere to any of its
material obligations under this Agreement, the Non- Defaulting Party must notify the
Defaulting Party, in writing, of such default and allow the Defaulting Party thirty (30)
days after its receipt of notice (the "Cure Period") to cure such default. If such default is
not cured within the Cure Period, the Non- Defaulting Party may terminate this
Agreement at any time thereafter upon written notice to the Defaulting Party. In
addition, if the same type of material default by the same Breaching Party shall take
place again during the term of this Agreement, the Non-Breaching Party who previously
gave notice of such type of material default may immediately terminate this Agreement
upon written notice to the Breaching Party. Where a given default, by its nature, would
require more than thirty (30) days to cure, the Defaulting Party shall be deemed to have
cured such default if: (a) the Defaulting Party has taken reasonable steps sufficient to
effect the cure prior to the termination of the Cure Period, (b) continues in good faith to

take actions sufficient to eliminate such default as soon as practicably possible and (c)
such default is cured within a commercially reasonable time.

In the event of termination of this Agreement by either party, all obligations and rights of
the parties hereunder shall cease except for the obligations and rights set forth in
Sections 1.01 (except in the case of a material uncured breach of Section 1.01 or Seller's
payment obligations hereunder), 1.02, 1.04, 1.05, 1.06, 1.07, 1.08, 5.01, 5.02, 5.03, 11.05
and 11.06 and Articles 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 10.0, and 12.0, the rights and obligations of which
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) the license and sublicense rights granted by
each party to the other party hereunder shall cease without further action by the parties,
(b) Purchaser 2 shall immediately cease using any part of or all of the Seller Licensed IP,
(c) Seller shall immediately cease using any part of or all of the Purchaser 2 Licensed IP,
(d) Seller shall return to Purchaser 2, promptly and without charge, all materials within
Seller's possession or control containing any or all of the Purchaser 2 Licensed IP, and
all copies thereof and (e) Purchaser 2 shall return to Seller promptly and without charge
all materials within Purchaser 2's possession or control containing any or all of the Seller
Licensed IP and Seller confidential information , and all copies thereof. For purposes of

medium of expression, in whatever form or format, whether now known or hereafter
